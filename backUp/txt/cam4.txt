RE AD I N G PASSAG E 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1–14 which are based on Reading Passage 1
below.

Adults and children are frequently confronted with
statements about the alarming rate of loss of tropical
rainforests. For example, one graphic illustration to
which children might readily relate is the estimate that
rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one
thousand football fields every forty minutes – about the
duration of a normal classroom period. In the face of the
frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that
children will have formed ideas about rainforests – what
and where they are, why they are important, what endangers them – independent of any formal tuition. It is also
possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken.
Many studies have shown that children harbour misconceptions about ‘pure’, curriculum science. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorporated into a multifaceted, but organised, conceptual framework, making it and the
component ideas, some of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to
modification. These ideas may be developed by children absorbing ideas through the
popular media. Sometimes this information may be erroneous. It seems schools may
not be providing an opportunity for children to re-express their ideas and so have them
tested and refined by teachers and their peers.
Despite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests,
little formal information is available about children’s ideas in this area. The aim of the
present study is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their educational strategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to
plan programmes in environmental studies in their schools.
The study surveys children’s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests.
Secondary school children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five
open-form questions. The most frequent responses to the first question were descriptions which are self-evident from the term ‘rainforest’. Some children described them
as damp, wet or hot. The second question concerned the geographical location of rainforests. The commonest responses were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43%
of children), South America (30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more
general locations, such as being near the Equator.
18

Reading

Responses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The dominant idea, raised by 64% of the pupils, was that rainforests provide animals with habitats. Fewer students responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer
mentioned the indigenous populations of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys
(60%) raised the idea of rainforest as animal habitats.
Similarly, but at a lower level, more girls (13%) than boys (5%) said that rainforests
provided human habitats. These observations are generally consistent with our previous studies of pupils’ views about the use and conservation of rainforests, in which
girls were shown to be more sympathetic to animals and expressed views which seem
to place an intrinsic value on non-human animal life.
The fourth question concerned the causes of the destruction of rainforests. Perhaps
encouragingly, more than half of the pupils (59%) identified that it is human activities
which are destroying rainforests, some personalising the responsibility by the use of
terms such as ‘we are’. About 18% of the pupils referred specifically to logging activity.
One misconception, expressed by some 10% of the pupils, was that acid rain is
responsible for rainforest destruction; a similar proportion said that pollution is
destroying rainforests. Here, children are confusing rainforest destruction with
damage to the forests of Western Europe by these factors. While two fifths of the students provided the information that the rainforests provide oxygen, in some cases this
response also embraced the misconception that rainforest destruction would reduce
atmospheric oxygen, making the atmosphere incompatible with human life on Earth.
In answer to the final question about the importance of rainforest conservation, the
majority of children simply said that we need rainforests to survive. Only a few of the
pupils (6%) mentioned that rainforest destruction may contribute to global warming.
This is surprising considering the high level of media coverage on this issue. Some
children expressed the idea that the conservation of rainforests is not important.
The results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of
children about rainforests. Pupils’ responses indicate some misconceptions in basic
scientific knowledge of rainforests’ ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as
habitats for animals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change
and destruction of rainforests.
Pupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of
causes of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreciation of either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex
social, economic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying
the rainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other
environmental issues suggest that older children seem to acquire the ability to appreciate, value and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in
which these skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future decision-makers.

What Do Whales Feel?
An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the
group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises

Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either
reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears
from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species,
on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known
whether these are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved
and migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may
have been nearly all sacriﬁced. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste
buds, the nerves serving these have degenerated or are rudimentary.
The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their
animals’ responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and freeranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members
of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to
maintain order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual
in most species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and
captive animals often object strongly to being touched there.

23

Test 1

The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen
species studied at close quarters underwater – speciﬁcally a grey whale calf in captivity for a year, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and ﬁlmed
off Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and
they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts the ﬁeld of vision in baleen whales that they probably do
not have stereoscopic vision.
On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests
that they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater
dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that
what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches
and tracks airborne ﬂying ﬁsh, it can apparently see fairly well through the air–water
interface as well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their
in-air vision is poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small ﬁsh out
of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.
Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which individual species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species
inhabiting clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and ﬂooded plains. The
South American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited
vision, and the Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow
them to sense only the direction and intensity of light.
Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in
water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by
cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although
they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation1. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited
in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead
whales in summer and the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales.
Toothed species in general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a
wider variety of sounds, than baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more
complicated sounds are clearly communicative, although what role they may play in
the social life and ‘culture’ of cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.

R EA D I N G PASSAG E 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27–40 which are based on Reading Passage 3
below.

Visual Symbols and the Blind
Part 1
From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate
the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other
surfaces in space. But pictures are more than literal representations.
This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind
woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to
draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a
curve inside the circle (Fig. 1). I was taken aback. Lines of motion,
such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history
of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm
Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually
no motion lines in his popular ﬁgures until about 1877.
Fig. 1
When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s
spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as
metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device
somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken
or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So
I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement
or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether
there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.
To search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of ﬁve different wheels,
depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extended beyond
the perimeter of the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels
and assign one of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group consisted of eighteen sighted
undergraduates from the University of Toronto.
All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most
guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the
wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent
spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes
extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signiﬁed that the wheel had its brakes on and
that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.

27

Test 1

In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for
the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely
higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind,
the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not
only ﬁgured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came
up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.
Part 2
We have found that the blind understand other kinds of visual metaphors as well. One
blind woman drew a picture of a child inside a heart – choosing that symbol, she said,
to show that love surrounded the child. With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from
China, I have begun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism
behind shapes such as hearts that do not directly represent their meaning.
We gave a list of twenty pairs of words to
sighted subjects and asked them to pick from
each pair the term that best related to a circle
and the term that best related to a square. For
example, we asked: What goes with soft? A
circle or a square? Which shape goes with
hard?
All our subjects deemed the circle soft and the
square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to the
circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed
less agreement: 79% matched fast to slow and
weak to strong, respectively. And only 51%
linked deep to circle and shallow to square.
(See Fig. 2.) When we tested four totally blind
volunteers using the same list, we found that
their choices closely resembled those made by
the sighted subjects. One man, who had been
blind since birth, scored extremely well. He
made only one match differing from the consensus, assigning ‘far’ to square and ‘near’ to
circle. In fact, only a small majority of sighted
subjects – 53% – had paired far and near to the
opposite partners. Thus, we concluded that the
blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted
people do.
