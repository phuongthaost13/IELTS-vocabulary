Introduction
The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is widely recognised as
a reliable means of assessing the language ability of candidates who need to study
or work where English is the language of communication. These Practice Tests are
designed to give future IELTS candidates an idea of whether their English is at the
required level.
IELTS is owned by three partners, Cambridge English Language Assessment, part of
the University of Cambridge, the British Council and IDP Education Pty Limited (through
its subsidiary company, IELTS Australia Pty Limited). Further information on IELTS can
be found on the IELTS website www.ielts.org.

WHAT IS THE TEST FORMAT?
IELTS consists of four components. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking
tests. There is a choice of Reading and Writing tests according to whether a candidate is
taking the Academic or General Training module.
Academic
For candidates wishing to study at
undergraduate or postgraduate levels,
and for those seeking professional
registration.

General Training
For candidates wishing to migrate to an
English-speaking country (Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, UK), and for those wishing to
train or study at below degree level.

The test components are taken in the following order:

.taf
Listening
4 sections, 40 items approximately 30 minutes
Academic Reading

Introduction

ACADEMIC TEST FORMAT
Listening
This test consists of four sections, each with ten questions. The first two sections are
concerned with social needs. The first section is a conversation between two speakers and
the second section is a monologue. The final two sections are concerned with situations
related to educational or training contexts. The third section is a conversation between up to
four people and the fourth section is a monologue.
A variety of question types is used, including: multiple choice, matching, plan/map/
diagram labelling, form completion, note completion, table completion, flow-chart completion,
summary completion, sentence completion, short-answer questions.
Candidates hear the recording once only and answer the questions as they listen. Ten
minutes are allowed at the end for candidates to transfer their answers to the answer sheet.

Reading
This test consists of three sections with 40 questions. There are three texts, which are
taken from journals, books, magazines and newspapers. The texts are on topics of general
interest. At least one text contains detailed logical! argument.
A variety of question types is used, including: multiple choice, identifying information
(True/False/Not Given), identifying the writer's views/claims (Yes/No/Not Given), matching
information, matching headings, matching features, matching sentence endings, sentence
completion, summary completion, note completion, table completion, flow-chart completion,
diagram label completion, short-answer questions.

Writing
This test consists of two tasks. It is suggested that candidates spend about 20 minutes on
Task 1, which requires them to write at least 150 words, and 40 minutes on Task 2, which
requires them to write at least 250 words. Task 2 contributes twice as much as Task 1 to the
Writing score.
Task 1 requires candidates to look at a diagram or some data (graph, table or chart) and
to present the information in their own words. They are assessed on their ability to organise,
present and possibly compare data, describe the stages of a process, describe an object or
event, or explain how something works.
In Task 2, candidates are presented with a point of view, argument or problem. They are
assessed on their ability to present a solution to the problem, present and justify an opinion,
compare and contrast evidence and opinions, evaluate and challenge ideas, evidence or
arguments.
Candidates are also assessed on their ability to write in an appropriate style.
More information on assessing the Writing test, including Writing Assessment Criteria
(public version), is available on the IELTS website.

Introduction

Speaking
This test takes between 11 and 14 minutes and is conducted by a trained examiner.
There are three parts:

Part 1
The candidate and the examiner introduce themselves. Candidates then answer general
questions about themselves, their home/family, their job/studies, their interests and a wide
range of similar familiar topic areas. This part lasts between four and five minutes.

Part 2
The candidate is given a task card with prompts and is asked to talk on a particular topic.
The candidate has one minute to prepare and they can make some notes if they wish,
before speaking for between one and two minutes. The examiner then asks one or two
questions on the same topic.

Part 3
The examiner and the candidate engage in a discussion of more abstract issues which are
thematically linked to the topic in Part 2. The discussion lasts between four and five minutes.
The Speaking test assesses whether candidates can communicate effectively in English.
The assessment takes into account Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical
Range and Accuracy, and Pronunciation. More information on assessing the Speaking test,
including Speaking Assessment Criteria (public version), is available on the IELTS website.

Introduction

HOW IS IELTS SCORED?
IELTS results are reported on a nine-band scale. In addition to the score for overall language
ability, IELTS provides a score in the form of a profile for each of the four skills (Listening,
Reading, Writing and Speaking). These scores are also reported on a nine-band scale. All
scores are recorded on the Test Report Form along with details of the candidate's nationality,
first language and date of birth. Each Overall Band Score corresponds to a descriptive
statement which gives a summary of the English language ability of a candidate classified at
that level. The nine bands and their descriptive statements are as follows:
9 Expert User- Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate, accurate and
fluent with complete understanding.
8 Very Good User- Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional
unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in
unfamiliar situations. Handles complex detailed argumentation well.
7 Good User - Has operational command of the language, though with occasional
inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally
handles complex language well and understands detailed reasoning.
6 Competent User- Has generally effective command of the language despite some
inaccuracies, inapprop_riacies and misunderstandings. Can use and understand fairly
complex language, particularly in familiar situations.
5 Modest User - Has partial command of the language, coping with overall meaning in
most situations, though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic
communication in own field.
4 Limited User - Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems
in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language.
3 Extremely Limited User- Conveys and understands only general meaning in very
familiar situations. Frequent breakdowns in communication occur.
2 Intermittent User - No real communication is possible except for the most basic
information using isolated words or short formulae in familiar situations and to meet
immediate needs. Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English.
1 Non User- Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated
words.
O Did not attempt the test- No assessable information provided.

Introduction

MARKING THE PRACTICE TESTS
Listening and Reading
The Answer Keys are on pages 124-131.
Each question in the Listening and Reading tests is worth one mark.

Questions which require letter I Roman numeral answers

•

For questions where the answers are letters or Roman numerals, you should write only
the number of answers required. For example, if the answer is a single letter or numeral
you should write only one answer. If you have written more letters or numerals than are
required, the answer must be marked wrong.

Questions which require answers in the form of words or numbers

• Answers may be written in upper or lower case.
• Words in brackets are optional - they are correct, but not necessary.
• Alternative answers are separated by a slash (/).
• If you are asked to write an answer using a certain number of words and/or (a)
number(s), you will be penalised if you exceed this. For example, if a question specifies
an answer using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS and the correct answer is 'black
leather coat'. the answer 'coat of black leather' is incorrect.
• In questions where you are expected to complete a gap, you should only transfer the
necessary missing word(s) onto the answer sheet. For example, to complete 'in the ... ',
and the correct answer is 'morning'. the answer 'in the morning' would be incorrect.
• All answers require correct spelling (including words in brackets).
• Both US and UK spelling are acceptable and are included in the Answer Key.
• All standard alternatives for numbers, dates and currencies are acceptable.
• All standard abbreviations are acceptable.
• You will find additional notes about individual answers in the Answer Key.

Writing
The sample answers are on pages 132-139. It is not possible for you to give yourself a mark
for the Writing tasks. We have provided sample answers (written by candidates), showing
their score and the examiner's comments. These sample answers will give you an insight
into what is required for the Writing test.

Introduction

HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES?
At the end of each Listening and Reading Answer Key you will find a chart which will help
you assess whether, on the basis of your Practice Test results, you are ready to take the
IELTS test.
In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind. Your
performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band Score
from 1 to 9 for each of the components and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which
is the average of your scores in the four components. However, institutions considering
your application are advised to look at both the Overall Band Score and the Bands for
each component in order to determine whether you have the language skills needed for a
particular course of study. For example, if your course has a lot of reading and writing, but
no lectures, listening skills might be less important and a score of 5 in Listening might be
acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a course which has lots of lectures
and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening might be unacceptable even though the
Overall Band Score was 7.
Once you have marked your tests, you should have some idea of whether your listening
and reading skills are good enough for you to try the IELTS test. If you did well enough in
one component, but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are ready
to take the test.
The Practice Tests have been checked to ensure that they are of approximately the same
level of difficulty as the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the
Practice Tests will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you
an idea of your possible future perfonnance and it is ultimately up to you to make decisions
based on your score.
Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have
based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept.
The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score than
most other institutions.

READING

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading
Passage 1 below.

Crop-growing skyscrapers
By the year 2050, nearly 80% of
the Earth's population will live in
urban centres. Applying the most
conservative estimates to current
demographic trends, the human
population will increase by about
three billion �eople by then. An
estimated 10 hectares of new land
(about 20% larger than Brazil) will be
needed to grow enoµgh food to feed
them, if traditional farming methods
continue as they are practised today.
At present, throughout the world,
over 80% of the land that is suitable
for raising crops is in use. Historically,
some 15% of that has been laid waste
by poor management practices. What
can be done to ensure enough food
for the worid's population to live on?
The concept of indoor farming is
not new, since hothouse production
of tomatoes and other produce has
been in vogue for some time. What
is new is the urgent need to scale
up this technology to accommodate
another three billion people. Many
believe an entirely new approach to
indoor farming is required, employing
cutting-edge technologies. One such
proposal is for the 'Vertical Farm'.
The concept is of multi-storey
18

buildings in which food crops are
grown in environmentally controlled
conditions. Situated in the heart of
urban centres, they would drastically
reduce the amount of transportation
required to bring food to consumers.
Vertical farms would need to be
efficient, cheap to construct and
safe to operate. If successfully
implemented, proponents claim,
vertical farms offer the promise
of urban renewal, sustainable
production of a safe and varied
food supply (through year-round
production of all crops), and the
eventual repair of ecosystems that
have been sacrificed for horizontal
farming.
It took humans 10,000 years to
learn how to grow most of the crops
we now take for granted. Along the
way, we despoiled most of the land
we worked, often turning verdant,
natural ecozones into semi-arid
deserts. Within that same time frame,
we evolved into an urban species, in
which 60% of the human population
now lives vertically in cities. This
means that, for the majority, we
humans have shelter from the
elements, yet we subject our food-

Reading

bearing plants to the rigours of the
great outdoors and can do no more
than hope for a good weather year.
However, more often than not now,
due to a rapidly changing climate,
that is not what happens. Massive
floods, long droughts, hurricanes and
severe monsoons take their toll each
year, destroying millions of tons of
valuable crops.
The supporters of vertical farming
claim many potential advantages for
the system. For instance, crops would
be produced all year round, as they
would be kept in artificially controlled,
optimum growing conditions. There
would be no weather-related crop
failures due to droughts, floods or
pests. All the food could be grown
organically, eliminating the need for
herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers.
The system would gre9tly reduce the
incidence of many infectious diseases
that are acquired at the agricultural
interface. Although the system would
consume energy, it would return
energy to the grid via methane
generation from composting non­
edible parts of plants. It would also
dramatically reduce fossil fuel use,
by cutting out the need for tractors,
ploughs and shipping.
A major drawback of vertical farming,
however, is that the plants would
require artificial light. Without it,
those plants nearest the windows
would be exposed to more sunlight
and grow more quickly, reducing

the efficiency of the system. Single­
storey greenhouses have the benefit
of natural overhead light: even so,
many still need artificial lighting.
A multi-storey facility with no natural
overhead light would require far
more. Generating enough light could
be prohibitively expensive, unless
cheap, renewable energy is available,
and this appears to be rather a future
aspiration than a likelihood for the
near future.
One variation on vertical farming that
has been developed is to grow plants
in stacked trays that move on rails.
Moving the trays allows the plants to
get enough sunlight. This system is
already in operation. and works well
within a single-storey greenhouse
with light reaching it from above: it
is not certain, however, that it can be
made to work without that overhead
natural light.
Vertical farming is an attempt to
address the undoubted problems
that we face in producing enough
food for a growing population. At the
moment, though, more needs to be
done to reduce the detrimental impact
it would have on the environment,
particularly as regards the use of
energy. While it is possible that
much of our food will be grown in
skyscrapers in future, most experts
currently believe it is far more likely
that we will simply use the space
available on urban rooftops.

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading
Passage 2 below.

THE FALKIRK WHEEL
A unique engineering achievement
The Falkirk Wheel in Scotland is the
world's first and only rotating boat lift.
Opened in 2002, it is central to the
ambitious £84.5m Millennium Link project
to restore navigability across Scotland by
reconnecting the historic waterways of the
Forth & Clyde and Union Canals.

headed axe, but also the vast turning
propeller of a ship, the ribcage of a whale
or the spine of a fish.

The major challenge of the project lay in
the fact that the Forth & Clyde Canal is
situated 35 metres below the level of the
Union Canal. Historically, the two canals
had been joined near the town of Falkirk
by a sequence of 11 locks - enclosed
sections of canal in which the water level
could be raised or lowered - that stepped
down across a distance of 1.5 km. This had
been dismantled in 1933, thereby breaking
the link. When the project was launched
in 1994, the British Waterways authority
were keen to create a dramatic twenty-first­
century landmark which would not only be
a fitting commemoration of the Millennium,
but also a lasting symbol of the economic
regeneration of the region.

The various parts of The Falkirk Wheel
were all constructed and assembled, like
one giant toy building set, at Butterley
Engineering's Steelworks in Derbyshire,
some 400 km from Falkirk. A team there
carefully assembled the 1,200 tonnes
of steel, painstakingly fitting the pieces
together to an accuracy of just 10 mm to
ensure a perfect final fit. In the summer of
2001, the structure was then dismantled
and transported on 35 lorries to Falkirk,
before all being bolted back together
again on the ground, and finally lifted into
position in five large sections by crane. The
Wheel would need to withstand immense
and constantly changing stresses as it
rotated, so to make the structure more
robust, the steel sections were bolted
rather than welded together. Over 45,000
bolt holes were matched with their bolts,
and each bolt was hand-tightened.

Numerous ideas were submitted for the
project, including concepts ranging from
rolling eggs to tilting tanks, from giant see­
saws to overhead monorails. The eventual
winner was a plan for the huge rotating
steel boat lift which was to become The
Falkirk Wheel. The unique shape of the
structure is claimed to have been inspired
by various sources, both manmade and
natural, most notably a Celtic double-

The Wheel consists of two sets of opposing
axe-shaped arms, attached about 25
metres apart to a fixed central spine.
Two diametrically opposed water-filled
' gondolas' , each with a capacity of 360,000
litres, are fitted between the ends of the
arms. These gondolas always weigh the
same, whether or not they are carrying
boats. This is because, according to
Archimedes' principle of displacement,
21

Test 1

floating objects displace their own weight
in water. So when a boat enters a gondola,
the amount of water leaving the gondola
weighs exactly the same as the boat. This
keeps the Wheel balanced and so, despite
its enormous mass, it rotates through 180°
in five and a half minutes while using very
little power. It takes just 1.5 kilowatt-hours
(5.4 MJ) of energy to rotate the Wheel roughly the same as boiling eight small
domestic kettles of water.
Boats needing to be lifted up enter the
canal basin at the level of the Forth &
Clyde Canal and then enter the lower
gondola of the Wheel. Two hydraulic steel
gates are raised, so as to seal the gondola
off from the water in the canal basin. The
water between the gates is then pumped
out. A hydraulic clamp, which prevents
the arms of the Wheel moving while the
gondola is docked, is removed, allowing
the Wheel to turn. In the central machine
room an array of ten hydraulic motors
then begins to rotate the central axle. The
axle connects to the outer arms of the

22

Wheel, which begin to rotate at a speed
of 1/8 of a revolution per minute. As the
wheel rotates, the gondolas are kept in
the upright position by a simple gearing
system. Two eight-metre-wide cogs orbit
a fixed inner cog of the same width,
connected by two smaller cogs travelling
in the opposite direction to the outer cogs
- so ensuring that the gondolas always
remain level. When the gondola reaches
the top, the boat passes straight onto the
aqueduct situated 24 metres above the
canal basin.
T he remaining 11 metres of lift needed
to reach the Union Canal is achieved by
means of a pair of locks. The Wheel could
not be constructed to elevate boats over
the full 35-metre difference between the
two canals, owing to the presence of the
historically important Antonine Wall, which
was built by the Romans in the second
century AD. Boats travel under this wall via
a tunnel, then through the locks, and finally
on to the Union Canal.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading
Passage 3 below.

Reducing the Effects of Climate Change
Mark Rowe reports on the increasingly ambitious geo-engi.neering projects
being explored by scientists
A

Such is our dependence on fossil fuels, and such is the volume of carbon dioxide already
released into the atmosphere, that many experts agree that significant global warming is now
inevitable. They believe that the best we can do is keep it at a reasonable level, and at present
the only serious option for doing this is cutting back on our carbon emissions. But while a few
countries are making major strides in this regard, the majority are having great difficulry even
stemming the race of increase, lee alone reversing it. Consequently, an increasing number of
scientists are beginning to explore the alternative of geo-engineering - a term which generally
refers co the intentional large-scale manipulation of the environment. According to its
proponents, geo-engineering is the equivalent of a backup generator: if Plan A - reducing our
dependency on fossil fuels - fails, we require a Plan B, employing grand schemes to slow down
or reverse the process of global warming.

B

Geo-engineering has b�en shown to work, at lease on a small localised scale. For decades, May
Day parades in Moscow have taken place under clear blue skies, aircraft having deposited dry
ice, silver iodide and cement powder to disperse clouds. Many of the schemes now suggested
look to do the opposite, and reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the planet. The most
eye-catching idea of all is suggested by Professor Roger Angel of the University of Ariwna. His
scheme would employ up co 16 trillion minute spacecraft, each weighing about one gram, to
form a transparent, sunlight-refracting sunshade in an orbit 1.5 million km above the Earth.
This could, argues Angel, reduce the amount of light reaching the Earth by two per cent.

C

The majority of geo-engineering projects so far carried out - which include planting forests
in deserts and depositing iron in the ocean to stimulate the growth of algae - have focused on
achieving a general cooling of the Earth. But some look specifically at reversing the melting
at the poles, particularly the Arctic. The reasoning is that if you replenish the ice sheets and
frozen waters of the high latitudes, more light will be reflected back into space, so reducing the
warming of the oceans and atmosphere.

D

The concept of releasing aerosol sprays into the stratosphere above the Arctic has been proposed
by several scientists. This would involve using sulphur or hydrogen sulphide aerosols so that
sulphur dioxide would form clouds, which would, in turn, lead to a global dimming. The idea
is modelled on historic volcanic explosions, such as that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
in 1991, which led co a shore-term cooling of global temperatures by 0.5 °C. Scientists have
also scrutinised whether it's possible to preserve the ice sheets of Greenland with reinforced
high-tension cables, preventing icebergs from moving into the sea. Meanwhile in the Russian
Arctic, geo-engineering plans include the planting of millions of birch trees. Whereas the
region's native evergreen pines shade the snow and absorb radiation, birches would shed their

25

Test 1
leaves in winter, thus enabling radiation ro be reflected by che snow. Re-routing Russian rivers
co increase cold water flow ro ice-forming areas could also be used ro slow down warming, say
some climate scientists.
E

Bue will such schemes ever be implemented? Generally speaking, those who are most cautious
about geo-engineering are the scientists involved in che research. Angel says that his plan is 'no
substitute for developing renewable energy: the only permanent solution'. And Dr Phil Rasch of
the US-based Pacific Northwest National Laborarory is equally guarded about che role of geo­
engineering: 'I chink all of us agree that if we were ro end geo-engineering on a given day, then
the planet would return ro its pre-engineered condition very rapidly, and probably within ten ro
cwency years. Thar's certainly something to worry about.'

F

The US National Center for Atmospheric Research has already suggested that the proposal
co inject sulphur into the atmosphere might affect rainfall patterns across the tropics and the
Southern Ocean. 'Geo-engineering plans co inject scrarospheric aerosols or co seed clouds would
ace ro cool the planet, and ace co increase the extent of sea ice,' says Rasch. 'Bue all the models
suggest some impact on the distribution of precipitation.'

G

'A further risk with geo-engineering projects is that you can "overshoot",' says Dr Dan
Lunt, from the University ofBristol's School of Geophysical Sciences, who has studied the
likely impacts of the sunshade and aerosol schemes on the climate. 'You may bring global
temperatures back co pre-industrial levels, buc the risk is that the poles will still be warmer than
they should be and the tropics will be cooler than before industrialisation.' To avoid such a
scenario, Lum says Angel's project would have to operate ac half strength; all of which reinforces
his view that the best option is co avoid the need for geo-engineering altogether.

H

The main reason why geo-engineering is supported by many in che scientific community is that
most researchers have lictle Faith in the ability of politicians to agree - and then bring in - the
necessary carbon cues. Even leading conservation organisations see the value of investigating the
potential of geo-engineering. According ro Dr Martin Sommerkorn, climate change advisor for
the World Wildlife Fund's International Arctic Programme, 'Human-induced climate change
has brought humanity to a position where we shouldn't exclude chinking thoroughly about this
topic and ics possibilities.'

Passage 1 below.

Raising the Mary Rose
How a sixteenth-century warship was recovered from the seabed
On 19 July 1545, English and French
fleets were engaged in a sea battle off
the coast of southern England in the
area of water called the Solent, between
Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. Among
the English vessels was a warship by the
name of Mary Rose. Built in Portsmouth
some 35 years earlier, she had had a long
and successful fighting career, and was
a favourite of King Henry VIII. Accounts
of what happened to the ship vary: while
witnesses agree that she was not hit
by the French, some maintain that she
was outdated, overladen and sailing too
low in the water, others that she was
mishandled by undisciplined crew. What
is undisputed, however, is that the Mary
Rose sank into.the Solent that day, taking
at least 500 men with her. After the battle,
attempts were made to recover the ship,
but these failed.
The Mary Rose came to rest on the
seabed, lying on her starboard (right) side
at an angle of approximately 60 degrees.
The hull (the body of the ship) acted as
a trap for the sand and mud carried by
Solent currents. As a result, the starboard
side filled rapidly, leaving the exposed
port (left) side to be eroded by marine
organisms and mechanical degradation.
Because of the way the ship sank, nearly

all of the starboard half survived intact.
During the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, the entire site became covered
with a layer of hard grey clay, which
minimised further erosion.
Then, on 16 June 1836, some fishermen
in the Solent found that their equipment
was caught on an underwater obstruction,
which turned out to be the Mary Rose.
Diver John Deane happened to be
exploring another sunken ship nearby,
and the fishermen approached him,
asking him to free their gear. Deane dived
down, and found the equipment caught
on a timber protruding slightly from the
seabed. Exploring further, he uncovered
several other timbers and a bronze
gun. Deane continued diving on the
site intermittently until 1840, recovering
several more guns, two bows, various
timbers, part of a pump and various other
small finds.
The Mary Rose then faded into obscurity
for another hundred years. But in 1965,
military historian and amateur diver
Alexander McKee, in conjunction with the
British Sub-Aqua Club, initiated a project
called 'Solent Ships'. While on paper
this was a plan to examine a number of
known wrecks in the Solent, what McKee
41

Test 2
really hoped for was to find the Mary
Rose. Ordinary search techniques proved
unsatisfactory, so McKee entered into
collaboration with Harold E. Edgerton,
professor of electrical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In 1967, Edgerton's side-scan sonar
systems revealed a large, unusually
shaped object, which McKee believed
was the Mary Rose.
Further excavations revealed stray
pieces of timber and an iron gun. But
the climax to the operation came when,
on 5 May 1971, part of the ship's frame
was uncovered. McKee and his team
now knew for certain that they had found
the wreck, but were as yet unaware
that it also housed a treasure trove of
beautifully preserved artefacts. Interest
in the project grew. and in 1979, The
Mary Rose Trust was formed, with Prince
Charles as its President and Dr Margaret
Rule its Archaeological Director. The
decision whether or not to salvage the
wreck was not an easy one, although
an excavation in 1978 had shown that it
might be possible to raise the hull. While
the original aim was to raise the hull if at
all feasible, the operation was not given
the go-ahead _until January 1982, when all
the necessary information was available.
An important factor in trying to salvage
the Mary Rose was that the remaining

42

hull was an open shell. This led to an
important decision being taken: namely to
carry out the lifting operation in three very
distinct stages. The hull was attached to
a lifting frame via a network of bolts and
lifting wires. The problem of the hull being
sucked back downwards into the mud was
overcome by using 12 hydraulic jacks.
These raised it a few centimetres over a
period of several days, as the lifting frame
rose slowly up its four legs. It was only
when the hull was hanging freely from
the lifting frame, clear of the seabed and
the suction effect of the surrounding mud,
that the salvage operation progressed to
the second stage. In this stage, the lifting
frame was fixed to a hook attached to a
crane, and the hull was lifted completely
clear of the seabed and transferred
underwater into the lifting cradle. This
required precise positioning to locate the
legs into the 'stabbing guides' of the lifting
cradle. The lifting cradle was designed
to fit the hull using archaeological survey
drawings, and was fitted with air bags to
provide additional cushioning for the hull's
delicate timber framework. The third and
final stage was to lift the entire structure
into the air, by which time the hull was
also supported from below. Finally, on 11
October 1982, millions of people around
the world held their breath as the timber
skeleton of the Mary Rose was lifted clear
of the water, ready to be returned home to
Portsmouth.

What destroyed the civilisation of Easter Island?
A

Easter Island, or Rapu Nui as it is known locally, is home to several hundred
ancient human statues - the moai. After this remote Pacific island was settled by
the Polynesians. it remained isolated for centuries. All the energy and resources
that went into the moai - some of which are ten metres tall and weigh over 7,000
kilos - came from the island itself. Yet when Dutch explorers landed in 1722, they
met a Stone Age culture. The moai were carved with stone tools, then transported
for many kilometres, without the use of animals or wheels, to massive stone
platforms. The identity of the moai builders was in doubt until well into the twentieth
century. Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer, thought the
statues had been created by pre-Inca peoples from Peru. Bestselling Swiss author
Erich von Daniken believed they were built by stranded extraterrestrials. Modern
science - linguistic, archaeological and genetic evidence - has definitively proved
the moai builders were Polynesians, but not how they moved their creations.
Local folklore maintains that the statues walked, while researchers have tended to
assume the ancestors dragged the statues somehow, using ropes and logs.

B

When the Europeans arrived, Rapa Nui was grassland, with only a few scrawny
trees. In the 1970s and 1980s, though, researchers found pollen preserved in
lake sediments, which proved the island had been covered in lush palm forests for
thousands of years. Only after the Polynesians arrived did those forests disappear.
US scientist Jared Diamond believes that the Rapanui people - descendants of
Polynesian settlers - wrecked their own environment. They had unfortunately
settled on an extremely fragile island - dry, cool, and too remote to be properly
fertilised by windblown volcanic ash. When the islanders cleared the forests for
firewood and farming, the forests didn't grow back. As trees became scarce and
they could no longer construct wooden canoes for fishing, they ate birds. Soil
erosion decreased their crop yields. Before Europeans arrived, the Rapanui had
descended into civil war and cannibalism, he maintains. The collapse of their
isolated civilisation, Diamond writes, is a 'worst-case scenario for what may lie
ahead of us in our own future'.

C

The moai, he thinks, accelerated the self-destruction. Diamond interprets them
as power displays by rival chieftains who, trapped on a remote little island, lacked
other ways of asserting their dominance. They competed by building ever bigger
figures. Diamond thinks they laid the moai on wooden sledges, hauled over log
rails, but that required both a lot of wood and a lot of people. To feed the people,
even more land had to be cleared. When the wood was gone and civil war began,
the islanders began toppling the moai. By the nineteenth century none were
standing.

Archaeologists Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii and Carl Lipo of California
State University agree that Easter Island lost its lush forests and that it was an
'ecological catastrophe' - but they believe the islanders themselves weren't to
blame. And the moai certainly weren't. Archaeological excavations indicate that the
Rapanui went to heroic efforts to protect the resources of their wind-lashed, infertile
fields. They built thousands of circular stone windbreaks and gardened inside them,
and used broken volcanic rocks to keep the soil moist. In short, Hunt and Lipo
argue, the prehistoric Rapanui were pioneers of sustainable farming.

E

Hunt and Lipo contend that moai-building was an activity that helped keep the
peace between islanders. They also believe that moving the moai required few
people and no wood, because they were walked upright. On that issue, Hunt and
Lipo say, archaeological evidence backs up Rapanui folklore. Recent experiments
indicate that as few as 18 people could, with three strong ropes and a bit of
practice, easily manoeuvre a 1,000 kg moai replica a few hundred metres. The
figures' fat bellies tilted them forward, and a D-shaped base allowed handlers to roll
and rock them side to side.

F

Moreover, Hunt and Lipo are convinced that the settlers were not wholly
responsible for the loss of the island's trees. Archaeological finds of nuts from the
extinct Easter Island palm show tiny grooves, made by the teeth of Polynesian
rats. The rats arrived along with the settlers, and in just a few years, Hunt and Lipo
calculate, they would have overrun the island. They would have prevented the
reseeding of the slow-growing palm trees and thereby doomed Rapa Nui's forest,
even without the settlers' campaign of deforestation. No doubt the rats ate birds'
eggs too. Hunt and Lipo also see no evidence that Rapanui civilisation collapsed
when the palm forest did. They think its population grew rapidly and then remained
more or less stable until the arrival of the Europeans, who introduced deadly
diseases to which islanders had no immunity. Then in the nineteenth century slave
traders decimated the population, which shrivelled to 111 people by 1877.

G

Hunt and Lipo's vision, therefore, is one of an island populated by peaceful and
ingenious nioai builders and careful stewards of the land, rather than by reckless
destroyers ruining their own environment and society. 'Rather than a case of abject
failure, Rapu Nui is an unlikely story of success', they claim. Whichever is the case,
there are surely some valuable lessons which the world at large can learn from the
story of Rapa Nui.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading
Passage 3 below.

Neuroaesthetics
An emerging discipline called neuroaesthetics is seeking to bring scientific objectivity to
the study of art, and has already given us a better understanding of many masterpieces.
The blurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain's amygdala, for
instance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why
many people find these pieces so moving.
Could the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from
Mondrian's geometrical blocks of colour, to Pollock's seemingly haphazard arrangements
of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such works simply
because they are famous. We certainly do have an inclination to follow the crowd. When
asked to make simple perceptual decisions such as matching a shape to its rotated image, for
example, people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see others doing the same.
It is easy to imagine that this mentality would have even more impact on a fuzzy concept like
art appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.
Angelina Hawley-Dolan, of.Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by
asking volunteers to view pairs of paintings - either the creations of famous abstract artists or
the doodles of infants, chimps and elephants. They then had to judge which they preferred.
A third of the paintings were given no captions, while many were labelled incorrectly volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp's messy brushstrokes when they were
actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers generally preferred
the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems
that the viewer can sense the artist's vision in paintings, even if they can't explain why.
Robert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates ambiguous works that
are neither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In one study, Pepperell and his
collaborators asked volunteers to decide how 'powerful'they considered an artwork to be,
and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer these
questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their neural
activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to
decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.

49

Test 2

And what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist exclusively of horizontal
and vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian's works are deceptively simple, but
eye-tracking studies confirm that they are meticulously composed, and that simply rotating a
piece radically changes the way we view it. With the originals, volunteers' eyes tended to stay
longer on certain places in the image, but with the altered versions they would flit across a
piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered versions less pleasurable
when they later rated the work.
In a similar study, Oshin Vartanian ofToronto University asked volunteers to compare original
paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the frame. He
found that almost everyone preferred the original, whether it was a Van Gogh still life or
an abstract by Miro. Vartanian also found that changing the composition of the paintings
reduced activation in those brain areas linked with meaning and interpretation.
In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual
intricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level of
detail to please the brain. Too little and the work is boring, but too much results in a kind of
'perceptual overload; according to Forsythe. What's more, appealing pieces both abstract and
representational, show signs of'fractals' - repeated motifs recurring in different scales. Fractals
are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain peaks or the branches
of trees. It is possible that our visual system, which evolved in the great outdoors, finds it
easier to process such patterns.
It is also intriguing that the brain appears to process movement when we see a handwritten
letter, as if we are replaying the writer's moment of creation. This has led some to wonder
whether Pollock's works feel so dynamic because the brain reconstructs the energetic actions
the artist used as he painted.This may be down to our brain's 'mirror neurons; which are
known to mimic others' actions.The hypothesis will need to be thoroughly tested, however. It
might even be the case that we could use neuroaesthetic studies to understand the longevity
of some pieces of artwork. While the fashions of the time might shape what is currently
popular, work� that are best adapted to our visual system may be the most likely to linger
once the trends of previous generations have been forgotten.
It's still early days for the field of neuroaesthetics - and these studies are probably only a taste
of what is to come. It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to a set of scientific
laws. We shouldn't underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist, their place
in history and the artistic environment of their time. Abstract art offers both a challenge and
the freedom to play with different interpretations. In some ways, it's not so different to science,
where we are constantly looking for systems and decoding meaning so that we can view and
appreciate the world in a new way.

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading
Passage 1 below.

THE STORY OF SILK
The history of the world's most luxurious fabric,
from ancient China to the present day
Silk is a fine, smooth material produced
from the cocoons - soft protective shells
- that are made by mulberry silkworms
(insect larvae). Legend has it that it was
Lei Tzu, wife of the Yellow Emperor,
ruler of China in about 3000 BC, who
discovered silkworms. One account of the
story goes that as she was taking a walk
in her husband's gardens, she discovered
that silkworms were responsible for the
destruction of several mulberry trees. She
collected a number of cocoons and sat
down to have a rest. It just so happened
that while she was sipping some tea, one
of the cocoons that she had collected
landed in the hot tea and started to
unravel into a fine thread. Lei Tzu found
that she could wind this thread around her
fingers. Subsequently, she persuaded her
husband to allow her to rear silkworms
on a grove of mulberry trees. She also
devised a special reel to draw the fibres
from the cocoon into a single thread so
that they would be strong enough to be
woven into fabric. While it is unknown
just how much of this is true, it is certainly
known that silk cultivation has existed in
China for several millennia.

Originally, silkworm farming was solely
restricted to women, and it was they
who were responsible for the growing,
harvesting and weaving. Silk quickly grew
into a symbol of status, and originally,
only royalty were entitled to have clothes
made of silk. The rules were gradually
relaxed over the years until flnally during
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911AD), even
peasants, the lowest caste, were also
entitled to wear silk. Sometime during the
Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), silk was
so prized that it was also used as a unit of
currency. Government officials were paid
their salary in silk, and farmers paid their
taxes in grain and silk. Silk was also used
as diplomatic gifts by the emperor. Fishing
lines, bowstrings, musical instruments
and paper were all made using silk The
earliest indication of silk paper being used
was discovered in the tomb of a noble
who is estimated to have died around
168AD.
Demand for this exotic fabric eventually
created the lucrative trade route now
known as the Silk Road, taking silk
westward and bringing gold, silver and

u�l�I ul,,j {!:?.>"
www.irLanguage.com

65

Test3
wool to the East. It was named the Silk
Road after its most precious commodity,
which was considered to be worth more
than gold. The Silk Road stretched over
6,000 kilometres from Eastern China to
the Mediterranean Sea, following the
Great Wall of China, climbing the Pamir
mountain range, crossing modem-day
Afghanist.an and going on to the Middle
East, with a major trading market in
Damascus. From there, the merchandise
was shipped across the Mediterranean
Sea Few merchants travelled the entire
route; goods were handled mostly by a
series of middlemen.
With the mulberry silkworm being native
to China, the country was the world's sole
producer of silk for many hundreds of
years. The secret of silk-making eventually
reached the rest of the world via the
Byzantine Empire, which ruled over the
Mediterranean region of southern Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East during
the period 330-1453 AD. According to
another legend, monks working for the
Byzantine emperor Justinian smuggled
silkworm eggs to Const.antinople
(lst.anbul in modem-day Turkey) in 660
AD, concealed inside hollow bamboo
walking canes.. The Byzantines were as
secretive as the Chinese, however, and
for many centuries the weaving and
trading of silk fabric was a strict imperial
monopoly. Then in the seventh century,
the Arabs conquered Persia, capturing
their magnificent silks in the process.
Silk production thus spread through
Africa, Sicily and Spain as the Arabs

66

swept through these lands. Andalusia in
southern Spain was Europe's main silk­
producing centre in the tenth century. By
the thirteenth century, however, Italy had
become Europe's leader in silk production
and export. Venetian merchants traded
extensively in silk and encouraged silk
growers to settle in Italy. Even now,
silk processed in the province of Como
in northern Italy eajoys an esteemed
reputation.
The nineteenth century and
industrialisation saw the downfall of the
European silk industry. Cheaper Japanese
silk, trade in which was greatly facilitated
by the opening of the Suez Canal, was one
of the many factors driving the trend. Then
in the twentieth century, new manmade
fibres, such as nylon, started to be used in
what had traditionally been silk products,
such as stockings and parachutes. The two
world wars, which interrupted the supply
of raw material from Japan, also stifled the
European silk industry. After the Second
World War, Japan's silk production was
restored, with improved production and
quality of raw silk. Japan was to remain
the world's biggest producer of raw silk,
and practically the only major exporter
of raw silk, until the 1970s. However, in
more recent decades, China has gradually
recaptured its position as the world's
biggest producer and exporter of raw
silk and silk yam. Today, around 126,000
metric tons of silk are produced in the
world, and almost two thirds of that
production takes place in China.

Great Migrations

Animal migration, however it is defined,
is far more than just the movement of
animals. It can loosely be described as travel
that takes place at regular intervals - often
in an annual cycle - that may involve many
members of a species, and is rewarded only
after a long journey. It suggests inherited
instinct. The biologist Hugh Dingle has
identified five characteristics that apply, in
varying degrees and combinations, to all
migrations. They are prolonged movements
that carry animals outside familiar habitats;
they tend to be linear, not zigzaggy; they
involve special behaviours concerning
preparation (such as overfeeding) and
arrival; they demand special allocations
of energy. And one more: migrating
animals maintain an intense attentiveness
to the greater mission, which keeps
them undistracted by temptations and
undeterred by challenges that would turn
other animals aside.
An arctic tern, 0n its 20,000 km flight
from the extreme south of South America
to the Arctic circle, will take no notice
of a nice smelly herring offered from a
bird-watcher's boat along the way. While
local gulls will dive voraciously for such
handouts, the tern flies on. Why? The arctic
tern resists distraction because it is driven
at that moment by an instinctive sense of
something we humans find admirable:
larger purpose. In other words, it is
determined to reach its destination. The
bird senses that it can eat, rest and mate
later. Right now it is totally focused on
the journey; its undivided intent is arrival.

Reaching some gravelly coastline in the
Arctic, upon which other arctic terns have
converged, will serve its larger purpose
as shaped by evolution: finding a place, a
time, and a set of circumstances in which it
can successfully hatch and rear offspring.
But migration is a complex issue, and
biologists define it differently, depending
in part on what sorts of animals they study.
Joel Berger, of the University of Montana,
who works on the American pronghorn
and other large terrestrial mammals, prefers
what he calls a simple, practical definition
suited to his beasts: ' movements from
a seasonal home area away to another
home area and back again' . Generally the
reason for such seasonal back-and-forth
movement is to seek resources that aren't
available within a single area year-round.
But daily vertical movements by
zooplankton in the ocean - upward by
night to seek food, downward by day to
escape predators - can also be considered
migration. So can the movement of aphids
when, having depleted the young leaves
on one food plant, their offspring then
fly onward to a different host plant, with
no one aphid ever returning to where it
started.
Dingle is an evolutionary biologist who
studies insects. His definition is more
intricate than Berger's, citing those five
features that distinguish migration from
other forms of movement. They allow
for the fact that, for example, aphids will

69

Test3

become sensitive to blue light (from the
sky) when it's time for takeoff on their
big journey, and sensitive to yellow light
(reflected from tender young leaves) when
it's appropriate to land. Birds will fatten
themselves with heavy feeding in advance
of a long migrational flight. The value of his
definition. Dingle argues, is that it focuses
attention on what the phenomenon
of wildebeest migration shares with
the phenomenon of the aphids. and
therefore helps guide researchers towards
understanding how evolution has produced
them all.
Human behaviour, however, is having a
detrimental impact on animal migration.
The pronghorn, which resembles an
antelope, though they are unrelated,
is the fastest land mammal of the New
World. One population, which spends the
summer in the mountainous Grand Teton
National Park of the western USA, follows a
narrow route from its summer range in the
mountains, across a river, and down onto
the plains. Here they wait out the frozen
months, feeding mainly on sagebrush
blown clear of snow. These pronghorn are
notable for the invariance of their migration
route and the severity of its constriction
at three bottlenecks. If they can't pass
through each of the three during their
spring migration, they can't reach their
bounty of summer grazing; if they can't

70

pass through again in autumn. escaping
south onto those windblown plains. they
are likely to die trying to overwinter in the
deep snow. Pronghorn. dependent on
distance vision and speed to keep safe from
predators, traverse high, open shoulders
of land, where they can see and run. At
one of the bottlenecks, forested hills rise to
form a V, leaving a corridor of open ground
only about 150 metres wide, filled with
private homes. Increasing development is
leading toward a crisis for the pronghorn,
threatening to choke off their passageway.
Conservation scientists, along with some
biologists and land managers within the
USA's National Park Service and other
agencies, are now working to preserve
migrational behaviours, not just species
and habitats. A National Forest has
recognised the path of the pronghorn.
much of which passes across its land, as a
protected migration corridor. But neither
the Forest Service nor the Park Service
can control what happens on private
land at a bottleneck. And with certain
other migrating species, the challenge is
complicated further - by vastly greater
distances traversed, more jurisdictions,
more borders, more dangers along the way.
We will require wisdom and resoluteness to
ensure that migrating species can continue
their journeying a while longer.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading
Passage 3 below.

Preface to 'How the other half thinks:
Adventures in mathematical reasoning'
A

Occasionally, in some difficult musical compositions, there are beautiful, but easy
parts - parts so simple a beginner could play them. So it is with mathematics as
well. There are some discoveries in advanced mathematics that do not depend on
specialized knowledge, not even on algebra, geometry, or trigonometry. Instead
they may involve, at most, a little arithmetic, such as 'the sum of two odd numbers
is even', and common sense. Each of the eight chapters in this book illustrates this
phenomenon. Anyone can understand every step in the reasoning.
The thinking in each chapter uses at most only elementary arithmetic, and
sometimes not even that. Thus all readers will have the chance to participate in a
mathematical experience, to appreciate the beauty of mathematics, and to become
familiar with its logical, yet intuitive, style of thinking.

B

One of my purposes in writing this book is to give readers who haven't had the
opportunity to see and enjoy real mathematics the chance to appreciate the
mathematical way of thinking. I want to reveal not only some of the fascinating
discoveries, but, more importantly, the reasoning behind them.
In that respect, this book differs from most books on mathematics written for the
general public. Some present the lives of colorful mathematicians. Others describe
important applications of mathematics. Yet others go into mathematical procedures,
but assume that the reader is adept in using algebra.

C

I hope this book will help bridge that notorious gap that separates the two cultures:
the humanities and the sciences, or should I say the right brain (intuitive) and the
left brain (analytical, numerical). As the chapters will illustrate, mathematics is not
restricted to the analytical and numerical; intuition plays a significant role. The
alleged gap can be narrowed or completely overcome by anyone,. in part because
each of us is far from using the full capacity of either side of the brain. To illustrate
our human potential, I cite a structural engineer who is an artist, an electrical
engineer who is an opera singer, an opera singer who published mathematical
research, and a mathematician who publishes short stories.

D

Other scientists have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have
necessarily had to omit the mathematics, although it provides the foundation of their
theories. The reader must remain a tantalized spectator rather than an involved
participant. since the appropriate language for describing the details in much of
science is mathematics, whether the subject is expanding universe, subatomic
particles, or chromosomes. Though the broad outline of a scientific theory can be
73

Test3
sketched intuitively, when a part of the physical universe is finally understood, its
description often looks like a page in a mathematics text.
E

Still, the non-mathematical reader can go far in understanding mathematical
reasoning. This book presents the details that illustrate the mathematical style
of thinking, which involves sustained, step-by-step analysis, experiments, and
insights. You will turn these pages much more slowly than when reading a novel
or a newspaper. It may help to have a pencil and paper ready to check claims and
carry out experiments.

F

As I wrote, I kept in mind two types of readers: those who enjoyed mathematics
until they were turned off by an unpleasant episode, usually around fifth grade, and
mathematics aficionados, who will find much that is new throughout the book.
This book also serves readers who simply want to sharpen their analytical skills.
Many careers, such as law and medicine, require extended, precise analysis. Each
chapter offers practice in following a sustained and closely argued line of thought.
That mathematics can develop this skill is shown by these two testimonials:

G

A physician wrote, The discipline of analytical thought processes [in mathematics]
prepared me extremely well for medical school. In medicine one is faced with a
problem which must be thoroughly analyzed before a solution can be found. The
process is similar to doing mathematics.'
A lawyer made the same point, 'Although I had no background in law - not even
one political science course - I did well at one of the best law schools. I attribute
much of my success there to having learned, through the study of mathematics,
and, in particular, theorems, how to analyze complicated principles. Lawyers who
have studied mathematics can master the legal principles in a way that most others
cannot.'
I hope you will share my delight in watching as simple, even na"ive, questions
lead to remarkable solutions and purely theoretical discoveries find unanticipated
applications.

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading
Passage 1 below.

Research using twins
To biomedical researchers all over the
world, twins offer a precious opportunity
to untangle the influence of genes and
the environment - of nature and nurture.
Because identical twins come from a
single fertilized egg that splits into two,
they share virtually the same genetic
code. Any differences between them one twin having younger looking skin, for
example - must be due to environmental
factors such as less time spent in the sun.
Alternatively, by comparing the
experiences of identical twins with
those of fraternal twins, who come from
separate eggs and share on average
half their DNA, researchers can quantify
the extent to which our genes affect our
lives. If identical twins are more similar
to each other with respect to an ailment
than fraternal twins are, then vulnerability
to the disease must be rooted at least in
part in heredity.
These two lines of research - studying
the differences between identical twins
to pinpoint the influence of environment,
and comparing identical twins with
fraternal ones to measure the role
of inheritance - have been crucial to
understanding the interplay of nature and
nurture in determining our personalities,
behavior, and vulnerability to disease.

The idea of using twins to measure the
influence of heredity dates back to 1875,
when the English scientist Francis Galton
first suggested the approach (and coined
the phrase 'nature and nurture'). But
twin studies took a surprising twist in
the 1980s, with the arrival of studies into
identical twins who had been separated
at birth and reunited as adults. Over two
decades 137 sets of twins eventually
visited Thomas Bouchard's lab in what
became known as the Minnesota Study of
Twins Reared Apart. Numerous tests were
carried out on the twins, and they were
each asked more than 15,000 questions.
Bouchard and his colleagues used this
mountain of data to identify how far
twins were affected by their genetic
makeup. The key to their approach was
a statistical concept called heritability.
In broad terms, the heritability of a trait
measures the extent to which differences
among members of a population can be
explained by differences in their genetics.
And wherever Bouchard and other
scientists looked, it seemed, they found
the invisible hand of genetic influence
helping to shape our lives.
Lately, however, twin studies have helped
lead scientists to a radical new conclusion:
that nature and nurture are not the only

87

Test4
elemental forces at work. According to a
recent field called epigenetics, there is a
third factor also in play, one that in some
cases serves as a bridge between the
environment and our genes, and in others
operates on its own to shape who we are.
Epigenetic processes are chemical
reactions tied to neither nature nor
nurture but representing what researchers
have called a 'third component'. These
reactions influence how our genetic
code is expressed: how each gene is
strengthened or weakened, even turned
on or off, to build our bones, brains and
all the other parts of our bodies.
If you think of our DNA as an immense
piano keyboard and our genes as the keys
- each key symbolizing a segment of DNA
responsible for a particular note, or trait,
and all the keys combining to make us
who we are - then epigenetic processes
determine when and how each key can be
struck, changing the tune being played.
One way the study of epigenetics is
revolutionizing our understanding of
biology is by revealing a mechanism by
which the environment directly impacts on
genes. Studies of animals, for example,
have shown that when a rat experiences
stress during pregnancy, it can cause
epigenetic changes in a fetus that lead to
behavioral problems as the rodent grows
up. Other epigenetic processes appear to
occur randomly, while others are normal,
such as those that guide embryonic cells

88

as they become heart, brain, or liver cells,
for example.
Geneticist Danielle Reed has worked with
many twins over the years and thought
deeply about what twin studies have
taught us. 'It's very clear when you look
at twins that much of what they share
is hardwired,' she says. 'Many things
about them are absolutely the same and
unalterable. But it's also clear, when you
get to know them, that other things about
them are different. Epigenetics is the
origin of a lot of those differences, in my
view.'
Reed credits Thomas Bouchard's work for
today's surge in twin studies. 'He was the
trailblazer.' she says. 'We forget that 50
years ago things like heart disease were
thought to be caused entirely by lifestyle.
Schizophrenia was thought to be due
to poor mothering. Twin studies have
allowed us to be more reflective about
what people are actually born with and
what's caused by experience.'
Having said that, Reed adds, the latest
work in epigenetics promises to take our
understanding even further. 'What I like
to say is that nature writes some things in
pencil and some things in pen.' she says.
'Things written in pen you can't change.
That's DNA But things written in pencil
you can. That's epigenetics. Now that
we're actually able to look at the DNA
and see where the pencil writings are, it's
sort of a whole new world.'

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading
Passage 2 below.

An Introduction to Film Sound
Though we might think of film as an
essentially visual experience, we really
cannot afford to underestimate the
importance of film sound. A meaningful
sound track is often as complicated as
the image on the screen, and is ultimately
just as much the responsibility of the
director. The entire sound track consists
of three essential ingredients: the human
voice, sound effects and music. These
three tracks must be mixed and balanced
so as to produce the necessary emphases
which in turn create desired effects.
Topics which essentially refer to the
three previously mentioned tracks are
discussed below. They include dialogue,
synchronous and asynchronous sound
effects, and music.

and very realistic persona emerges. The
viewer sees not an actor working at his
craft, but another human being struggling
with life. It is interesting to note that how
dialogue is used and the very amount of
dialogue used varies widely among films.
For example, in the highly successful
science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue
was evident, and most of it was banal
and of little intrinsic interest. In this
way the film-maker was able to portray
what Thomas Sobochack and Vivian
Sobochack call, in An Introduction to Film,
the 'inadequacy of human responses
when compared with the magnificent
technology created by man and the visual
beauties of the universe'.

Let us start with dialogue. As is the case
with stage drama, dialogue serves to
tell the story and expresses feelings and
motivations of characters as well. Often
with film charaeterization the audience
perceives little or no difference between
the character and the actor. Thus, for
example, the actor Humphrey Bogart is
the character Sam Spade; film personality
and life personality seem to merge.
Perhaps this is because the very texture of
a performer's voice supplies an element
of character.

The comedy Bringing Up Baby, on the
other hand, presents practically non-stop
dialogue delivered at breakneck speed.
This use of dialogue underscores not
only the dizzy quality of the character
played by Katherine Hepburn, but also
the absurdity of the film itself and thus its
humor. The audience is bounced from gag
to gag and conversation to conversation;
there is no time for audience reflection.
The audience is caught up in a whirlwind
of activity in simply managing to follow
the plot. This film presents pure escapism
- largely due to its frenetic dialogue.

When voice textures fit the performer's
physiognomy and gestures, a whole

Synchronous sound effects are those
sounds which are synchronized or

91

Test 4
matched with what is viewed. For
example, if the film portrays a character
playing the piano, the sounds of the
piano are projected. Synchronous sounds
contribute to the realism of film and also
help to create a particular atmosphere.
For example, the 'click' of a door being
opened may simply serve to convince
the audience that the image portrayed
is real, and the audience may only
subconsciously note the expected sound.
However, if the 'click' of an opening
door is part of an ominous action such
as a burgl ary, the sound mixer may call
attention to the 'click' with an increase in
volume; this helps to engage the audience
in a moment of suspense.
Asynchronous sound effects, on the other
hand, are not matched with a visible
source of the sound on screen. Such
sounds are included so as to provide an
appropriate emotional nuance, and they
may also add to the realism of the film.
For example, a film-maker might opt
to include the background sound of an
ambulance's siren while the foreground
sound and image portrays an arguing
couple. The asynchronous ambulance
siren underscores the psychic injury
incurred in the argument; at the same
time the noise of the siren adds to the
realism of the film by acknowledging the
film's city setting.

92

We are probably all familiar with
background music in films, which has
become so ubiquitous as to be noticeable
in its absence. We are aware that it is used
to add emotion and rhythm. Usually not
meant to be noticeable, it often provides
a tone or an emotional attitude toward
the story and/or the characters depicted.
In addition, background music often
foreshadows a change in mood. For
example, dissonant music may be used in
film to indicate an approaching (but not
yet visible) menace or disaster.
Background music may aid viewer
understanding by linking scenes. For
example, a particular musical theme
associated with an individual character
or situation may be repeated at various
points in a film in order to remind the
audience of salient motifs or ideas.
Film sound comprises conventions and
innovations. We have come to expect an
acceleration of music during car chases
and creaky doors in horror films. Yet, it
is important to note as well that sound
is often brilliantly conceived. The effects
of sound are often largely subtle and
often are noted by only our subconscious
minds. We need to foster an awareness of
film sound as well as film space so as to
truly appreciate an art form that sprang
to life during the twentieth century - the
modem film.

'This Marvellous Invention'
A

Of all mankind's manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other inventions the wheel, agriculture, sliced bread - may have transformed our material existence, but the
advent of language is what made us human. Compared to language, all other inventions pale
in significance, since everything we have ever achieved depends on language and originates
from it. Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to unparalleled
power over all other animals, and even over nature itself.

B

But language is foremost not just because it came first. In its own right it is a tool of
extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: 'this marvellous
invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of
expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow
us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot penetrate
it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul'. This was how, in 1660,
the renowned French grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles distilled the
essence of language, and no one since has celebrated more eloquently the magnitude of its
achievement. Even so, there is just one flaw in all these hymns of praise, for the homage to
language's unique accomplishment conceals a simple yet critical incongruity. Language is
mankind's greatest invention - except, of course, that it was never invented. This apparent
paradox is at the core of our fascination with language, and it holds many of its secrets.

C

Language often seems so skillfully drafted that one can hardly imagine it as anything other
than the perfected handiwork of a master craftsman. How else could this instrument
make so much out of barely three dozen measly morsels of sound? In themselves, these
configurations of mouth - p,f,b, v,t,d,k,g,sh,a,e and so on - amount to nothing more than a
few haphazard spits and splutters, random noises with no meaning, no ability to express,
no power to explain. But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language machine,
let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless
streams of air cannot do: from sighing the interminable boredom of existence to unravelling
the fundamental order of the universe.

O

The most extraordinary thing about language, however, is that one doesn't have to be a
genius to set its wheels in motion. The language machine allows just about everybody from pre-modern foragers in the subtropical savannah, to post-modern philosophers in the
suburban sprawl - to tie these meaningless sounds together into an infinite variety of subtle
senses, and all apparently without the slightest exertion. Yet it is precisely this deceptive ease
which makes language a victim of its own success, since in everyday life its triumphs are
usually taken for granted. The wheels of language run so smoothly that one rarely bothers to
stop and think about all the resourcefulness and expertise that must have gone into making
it tick. Language conceals art.

Test4
E

Often, it is only the estrangement of foreign tongues, with their many exotic and outlandish
features, that brings home the wonder of language's design. One of the showiest stunts that
some languages can pull off is an ability to build up words of breath-breaking length, and
thus express in one word what English takes a whole sentence to say. The Turkish word
fehirlili?tiremediklerimizdensiniz, to take one example, means nothing less than 'you are
one of those whom we can't turn into a town-dweller'. (In case you were wondering. this
monstrosity really is one word, not merely many different words squashed together - most of
its components cannot even stand up on their own.)

F

And if that sounds like some one-off freak, then consider Sumerian, the language spoken
on the banks of the Euphrates some 5,000 years ago by the people who invented writing
and thus enabled the documentation of history. A Sumerian word like munintumaa ('when
he had made it suitable for her') might seem rather trim compared to the Turkish colossus
above. What is so impressive about it, however, is not its lengthiness but rather the reverse
- the thrifty compactness of its construction. The word is made up of different slots, each
corresponding to a particular portion of meaning. This sleek design allows single sounds
to convey useful information, and in fact even the absence of a sound has been enlisted to
express something specific. If you were to ask which bit in the Sumerian word corresponds
to the pronoun 'it' in the English translation 'when he had made it suitable for her: then the
answer would have to be nothing. Mind you, a very particular kind of nothing: the nothing
that stands in the empty slot in the middle. The technology is so fine-tuned then that even a
non-sound, when carefully placed in a particular position, has been invested with a specific
function. Who coul.d possibly have come up with such a nifty contraption?

Hello?
Oh, hello. I wanted to enquire about hiring a room in the Village Hall, for the
evening of September the first.
Let me just see ... Yes, we have both rooms available that evening. There's our
Main Hall - that's got seating for 2QQ people. Or there's the Charlton Room . . .
Sorry?
The� Room - C-H-A-R L-T-0-N. That's got seating for up to one
hundred.
Well, we're organising a dinner to raise money for a charity, and we're hoping for at
least 150 people, so I think we'll go for the Main Hall. How much would that cost?
Let's see. You wanted it for the evening of September 1st?
Yes, that's a Saturday.
So from six pm to midnight that'd be £115. - that's the weekend price, it's £75 on
weekdays.
That's all right.
And I have to tell you there's also a deposit of £250, which is returnable of course
as long as there's no damage. But we do insist that this is pajd jn cash, we don't
take cards for that. You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like
though - cash, credit card, cheque ...
Oh, well I suppose that's OK. So does the charge include use of tables and chairs
and so on?
Oh, yes.
And what about parking?
Yeah that's au inciuded . The only thing that isn't included is ... you said you were
organising a dinner?
Yeah.
Well, you'll have to pay extra for the kitchen if you want to use that. It's £25. It's got
very good facilities - good quality cookers and fridges and so on.
OK, well I suppose that's all right. We can cover the cost in our entry charges.
Right. So I'll make a note of that. Now there are just one or two things you need
to think about before the event. For example, you'll have to see about gett inga
licence if you 're planning to have any music during the meat .
Oh, really?
It's quite straightforward, I'll give you the details later on. And about a week or ten

Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm. This open-air museum gives you the
experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the nineteenth
century. So you'll see a typical farm of that period, and like me, all the staff are dressed in
clothes of that time.
I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further. As it's a working farm,
please don't frig hte n o r injur e the animals. We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds
that are now quite rare.

011

And do stay at a safe d istance from t he tools: some of them have sharp points which can be
pretty dange rous. so p lease don't touch them. We don't want any accidents, do we?

012

The ground is very uneven, and you might slip if you're wearing sandals so I'm glad to see
you 'r e a ll wearing s hoes - we always advise people to do that.

Q 13

Now, children of all ages are very welcome here, and usually even very young children love
the ducks and lambs, so do bring them along next time you come.
I don't think a ny of you have broug ht dogs with you. but in case you have I'm afraid they'll
have to stay in the car park. un less they're gu ide dogs. I'm sure you'll understand that they
could cause a lot of problems on a farm.

104

014

Test 1
Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm. The building where you bought your
tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right, and we're now at the beginning of the main
path to the farmland - and of course the car park is on your left . The scarecrow you can see 015
in the car park in the corner beside the main path, is a traditional figure for keeping the birds
away from crops, but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture. It's taller than a human being,
so you can see it from quite a distance.
If you look ahead of you. you'll see a maze. It's opposite the New Barn beside the side pa th
that branches off to the right just over there. The maze is made out of hedges which are too
tall for young children to see over them, but it's quite small, so you can't get lost in it!

016

Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path? If you want to go Qt 7
to the cafe go towar ds the bridge and turn right just before it. Walk along the side pat h and
the cafe's on the fi rst bend you come to. The building was originally the schoolhouse. and it's
well over a hundred years old.
As you may know, we run skills workshops here, where you can learn traditional crafts like
woodwork and basket-making. You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about
018
the courses, in the Black Barn. If you take the side path to the right here, just by the New
Barn you'll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends.
Now I mustn't forget to tell you about picnicking, as I can see some of you have brought your
lunch with you. You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course. Qrjf_
you'd prefer a covered picnic area there's one near the f armyard: just after you cross the
bridge. there's a cov er ed picnic spot on the right.
And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself. From here you can cross the brid ge the n
walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard. That goes to the house ,
and it'll give you a lovely view_of it. It's certainly worth a few photographs, but as it's a private
home, I'm afraid you can't go inside.

Q19

020

Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our tour of the farm.

OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned - the one about the
study on gender in physics.
About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team? Yeah. I was
interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.
That's an unusual combination.
Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.
They weren't actually majoring in physics - they wer e majoring in what's known as the 021
STE M disciplines . That's science technology e ngineering and ...
... and math. Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies.
That's correct. So as I understood it, Miyake and co started from the fact that women
are underrepresented in introductory physics courses at college, and also that on
average, the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the
men. No one really knows why this is the case.
022
Yeah. But what the resear chers wanted to find o ut was bas ically what they could do
about the relativel y low level of the women's r esults . But in order to find a solution they
needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.
Right - now let's see if I can remember ... it was that in the physics class, the female
students thought the male students all assumed that women weren't any good at
physics ... was that it? And they thought that the men expected them to get poor
results in their tests.

Anyway, what Miyake's team did was quite simple - getting the students to do some
writing before they went into the physics class. What did they call it?
Values-affirmation - they had to wri te an essay focusin g o n things that w ere significant
to them not particula rly to do with the sub ject they w ere study in g but mor e general
things like music or people w ho matte red to them .
Right. So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a
positive way.
And putting these tho ugh ts into words can relax them and help them overco me the
psycholog ical factors that lead to poo r perf ormance. Yeah. But w hat the researchers
in the study hadn't ex pected was that this one ac tivi ty raised the women's physics
grades fr om t he to the B range .
A huge change. Pity it wasn't to an A, but still! No, but it does suggest that the women
were seriously underperforming beforehand. in comparison with the men.
Yes. Mind you, Miyake's article left out a lot of details. Like, did the students do the
writing just once, or several times? And had t hey been to ld why they w ere do ing the
writing? That might h ave affected the resul ts.
You mean. if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve. then
they'd just try to fulfil that expectation?
Exactly.

So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study, but investigate
whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.
usA: OK. So we could askJhem to do a writing task about something completely different ...
something more factual? Like a general knowledge topic.
GREG: Maybe ... or we could have half the students doing a writing task and half doing
something else, like an oral task.
usA: Or even. ha lf do the same w riting task as in the o riginal resear ch and half do a
028
factual wri ting task. Then we'd see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or
something else.
GREG: That's it. Good. So at our meeting with the supervisor on Monday we can tell him
we've decided on our project. We should have our aims ready by then. I suppose we
need to read the original study - the article's just a summary.
usA: And there ·was another article I read, by Smolinsky. It was about her research on how
women and men perform in mixed teams in class. compared with single-sex teams
and on their own.
GREG: Let me guess ... the women were better at teamwork.
029
LISA: That's what I expected, but actually the men and t he women got the sa me results
whethe r they were workin g in te ams or on the ir own. But I guess it's not that relevant
to us.
GREG: What worries me anyway is how we're going to get everything done in the time.
USA: We'll be OK now we know what we're doing. Though I'm not clear how we assess
whether the students in our experiment actually make any progress or not ...
GREG: No. We may need some advice on that. The main thing's to make sure we have the
right size sample, not too big or too small.
LISA: That shouldn't be difficult. Right, what do we need to do next? We could have a
look at the timetable for the science classes ... or perhaps w e should jus t ma ke a n
030
appoint me nt to see one of t he scien ce p rofessors. Th at'd be better.
GREG: Great. And we could even get to observe one of the classes.
LISA: What for?
GREG: Well ... OK maybe let's just go with your idea. Right, well ...

SECTION 4
I've been looking at ocean biodiversity, that's the diversity of species that live in the world's
oceans. About 20 years ago biologists developed the idea of what they called 'biodiversity
hotspots'. These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so one example
is Madagascar. These hotspots are significant because they a ll ow us to locate key areas for
focusjng eff orts at co nservatio n. Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily, but until
recently, very little was known about species distribution and diversity in the oceans, and no
one even knew if hotspots existed there.

031

Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean
species that he got from the fishing industry. Worm located five hotspots for large ocean
predators like sharks, and looked at what they had in common. The main thing he'd expec ted 032
to find was that they had very high concentrations of food but to his surprise that was only
true for four of the hotspots - the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in t hat regard. But
033
what he did find was that in all cases, the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively
high temperatures even when it was cool at greater depths , so this seemed to be a factor in
supporting a diverse range of these large predators. However, this wasn't enough on its own,
034
because he also f ound that the water needed to h ave enou gh oxygen in it - so these two
factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish.
A couple of years later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Ballance, who was working in
California, also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish - what she was interest ed
in was marine mammals. things like seals . And she found three places in the oceans which
were hotspots, and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at
boundaries between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of
the plankton that some of these species feed on.
So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much
information as possible. For example, there's an international project called the Census of
Marine Life. They've been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic. Qne..
thing they f ound there which stunned other researchers was t hat there were large numbers
of species which live below the ice - sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick. Some
of these species had never been seen before. They've even found species of octopus living
in these conditions. And other scientists working on the same project, but researching very
different habitats on the ocean floor, have found large numbers of species congregating
around volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.

035

036

However, biologists still don't know how serious the threat to their survival is for each
individual species. So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating
a list of endangered species on land, so they consider things like the size of the population
- how many members of one species there are in a particular place - and then they look at
their distribution in geographical terms, although this is quite difficult when you're looking at
fish, because they're so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of 037
the species is happening.
So far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to
20,000. For each one the y assess. they use the data they collect on t hat spec i es to pr oduce
a map showing its djstributio n. Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only
where most species are located but also where they are most threatened.

038

So finally, what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the world's oceans? Firstly,
we need to set up more reserves in our oceans, places where marine species are protected.
We have some, but not enough. In addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles,

107

Audioscripts
which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need
to create corridors for migration, so they can get from one area to another safely. As well as
this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas to prevent overfishing of
endangered species. And finally, there's the problem of 'by-catch'. This refers to the catching
of unwanted fish by fishing boats - they're returned to the sea, but they're often dead or
dying. If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective, SQ.1ha1.
only the fish wanted for consumption were caught, this problem could be overcome.

Good Morning. Youth Council. Caroline speaking.
Oh, hello, I'm interested in standing for election to the Youth Council, and I was told
to give you a call.
That's good. Could I have your name, please?
Yes, it's Roger Brown.
Thank you. I'm Caroline, the Youth Council administrator. So do you know much
about what the Council does, Roger?
I've talked to Stephanie - I think she's the chair of the Council.
That's right.
And she told me a lot about it. How it's a way for young people to discuss local
issues, for example, and make suggestions to the town council. That's what made
me interested.
Fine. Well let me take down some of your details. First of all, how old are you? You
know the Council is for young people aged from 13 to 18?
I've just turned 18.
And where do you live, Roger?
Well, that's a bit complicated. At the moment I'm looking for a flat to rent here,
so I'm in a hostel from Monday to Friday. I go back to my parents' place at the
weekend.
OK, so where's the best place to send you some information about the Council?
Oh, to my parents' address, please. That's 17, Bycklejah Street - B-U-C-K-L-E-1G-H Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire, though you don't really need the county.
Oh, I know Stamford - it's a lovely town. And what's the postcode?
PE9 7QT
Right, thank you. So are you working here, or are you a student?
I started studying at the university a couple of weeks ago, and I've got a part-time
job for a few hours a week.
What do you do?
Well, I've done several different things. I've just finished a short-term contract as a
courier, and now I'm workjna as awaiter in one of the big hotels.
Uhuh. That can't leave you much time for studying!
Oh, it's not too bad. I manage to fit it all in.
What are you studying?
My ambition is to go into parliament eventually, so my major subject is poljtjcs .
That's partly why I think the Youth Council is important and want to be a part of it.

And I suppose you're also taking a minor subject, aren't you? I know a lot of people

I chose history. To be honest, I'm not finding it as interesting as I expected!
OK, so with your studying and your part-time job, do you have time for any other
interests or hobbies?
Well, I spend quite a lot of time cycling - both around town to get to university and
to work, and also long-distance, from here to London, for instance.
That's pretty impressive! Anything else?
For relaxation I'm also keen on the cinema - I used to go at least once a week, but
I can't manage to go so often now.
Right. Are you sure you'll have enough time for the Youth Council?
Yes, I've worked out that I can afford to reduce my hours at work, and that will
make the time.
So is there any particular aspect of the Youth Council's work that appeals to you,
Roger?
Well, my sister is blind, so I'm particularly inter es ted in working wi th dis abled young
�. to try and improve the quality of their lives.
That's great. Well, the best way to get involved is to be nominated by some people
who you know.
Right. Can you tell me how to set about organising that?
You should talk to Jeffrey, our Elections Officer. I can arrange a meeting in the
council office with him, if you like.
Yes, please.
He'll be here next Monday, if that suits you.
That's the 14th, isnJ it?
Yes.
I can manage late afternoon.
Would you like to suggest a time? He generally leaves around 5.30.
Well, would 4.30 be OK? My last class finishes at 4, so I'd have plenty of time to
get to your office.
Right, that's fine. Oh, and could I have a phone number we can contact you on?
Yes, my mobile number's 07788 136711.
Thank you. Well, we'll look forward to seeing you next week.
Thanks very much. Goodbye.

Hi. Great to see you! I'm Jody, and I'll be looking after both of you for the first month you're
working here at the Amersham Theatre. I'll tell you something about the theatre now, then
take you to meet two of the other staff.
It's an old building, and it's been modernised several times. In fact, as you can see, we're
carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment. The interior has just been repainted, and
we're about to start on the exterior of the building - that'll be a big job. The work's running
over budget, so we've had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you're happy running
up and down stairs! When the theatre was built, people were generally slimmer and shorter
than now, and the seats were very close together. We've replaced them with larger seats.
with more legroom. This means fewer sea ts in total. but we've taken the opportunity to install
seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces. We've also turned a few

sto reroo ms ove r to other purposes like using them for meet ings.
We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre. O ne way is by o rganis ing
013 & 14
backstage tours. so people can be shown round the building and learn ho wa theatre
operates. These are pro ving very popular. What we"re finding is that people want to have
lunch or a cup of coffee while they're here, so we're looking into the possibility of opening
013 & 14
a cafe in due course. We have a books hop. which specia lises in books a bout drama. a nd
th at att racts ple nty o f c u sto mers. Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next
month, and they'l l be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties.
We're also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.
Now I want to tell you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops
that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we're waiting until
we've got the right people in place as trainers. That's proving more difficult than we'd
expected! There's a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production,
and our light ing wor1<shop has already started with g reat success. We're going to start one
on sound next month. A number of people have enquired about workshops on make-up,
and that's something we're considering for the future. A surpr ise success is t he wor1<sh oo o n
making puppets - w e happen to h av e someo ne working he re who does it as ahobby. and
she offered to r una work shop. It was so popular we'r e n ow running them every month!

Now, a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for
the actors are all below ground level. Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms
that the public doesn't see. The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light
them.
Standing here in the foyer, y_ou're probably wondering why the box office isn't here, where the
public would expect to find it. Well, you might have noticed it on your way in - although .[s_

part o f this building. it's n ext door. with aseparate entrance from the road.
For the theatr e manager's office. you go across the foyer and th rough the doub le doo rs tum

Right. What did you have?
I just put something about getting experience of the different sorts of procedures
used on a field trip. But we need something about what causes different organisms to 0 21

In our aims? But we weren't really looking at that.
I suppose not. OK, now there's the list of equipment we all had to bring on the field
trip. What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?
It was something about measuring the slope of the shore, but of course we didn't
need it because we were measuring wind direction, and we'd brought the compass
for that ...
But not the piece o f string to hold up in the air' Didn't Mr B lake makeafuss about us 022
leaving that behind.
Yeah. He does go on. Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the students.
Now, the next section's the procedure. I sent you the draft of that.
Yeah. It was clear, but I don't think we need all th ese details of what time we left and 023
what ti me we got back and how we divided up the different research tasks .
OK. I'll look at that again.
Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail. S o l et's begin with
024
how we measu r ed wa ve speed . I was surprised how str aightforwar d that w as.
I'd expected u s to have some sort of hi gh-tech device not just stand there and
count the number of waves per minute. Not very precise, but I suppose it was good
enough. But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.
In the water from the rock pools?
Yeah, oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed
those samples - was it potassium chromate and silver nitrate?
That's right.
OK. And we need the map of the seashore. You just left that to me. And I had to do
025
it while the tide was low, well that was OK, but the place I started it from was down
on the beac h then I reali sed I shou ld h ave gone up higher to get better vis ibility, so
I had to start all over again. But at least I'd got the squared paper or I'd have had
problems drawing it all to scale.
Yes. It looks good. We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we
need to make any changes.
I had a look but I couldn't find anything. But you took some pictures, didn't you?
Yeah. I'll email you them if you want.
OK. 1·11 make my amendme nts using those then I can scan it into our report.
026
Great.
Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different
zones we.identified on the shore and the problems organisms face in each zone. So
for the highest area ...
... the splash zone?
Yeah, we found mostly those tiny shellfish that have strong hard shells that act as
protection.
But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?
No, that's not the main danger for them. But the shells prevent them from dryjng o ut 027 & 28
because they're in the open airfor most of the time.
Right. And since they're exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of shelter, or
cover themselves up, so they don't ge t too hot . Then in the middle and lower zones, 027 & 28
nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action ...
Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being swept
away, or even destroyed by being smashed against the rocks.
I haven't done anything on the geological changes. I don't know what to put for that.
No, we weren't concentrating on that. Maybe we need to find some websites.
Good idea. I've got the lecture notes from Mr Blake's geology course, but they're
too general. But we could ask him which books on our Reading List might be most
helpful.

Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our
research, but I don't know if you agree. For example, the size of the sample, and
whether it's big enough to make any general conclusions from. But I thought actually
we did have quite a big sample.
We did. And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable. But we might
not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go.
Yeah. we might have missed some organisms - if they were hiding under a rock for
ei@!!!Q]e. I wasn't sure about the way we described their habitats. I decided it was
probably OK.
Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms, they weren't very
detailed, but they were adequate in this context. I'm not sure we identifi ed all t he
species correctly though.
OK, we'd better mention that. Now, how ...

SECTION 4
We've been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic
buildings. I'm going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings, and I'll
illustrate this by referring to the new Taylor Concert Hall that's recently been completed here
in the city.
So, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an architect needs to
consider the function of the building - for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment,
or for education, or for administration? The second thing the architect needs to think about
is the context of the building, this includes its physical location. obviously but it also includes 031
the social meaning of the building how it relates to the people it's built for. And finally, for
important public buildings, the architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on
which to base the design, a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used.
Let's look at the new Taylor Concert Hall in relation to these ideas. The location chosen
032
wasa site ina run-down district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans. It
w as occupied by a factory that had been empty for some years. The whole area was some
distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre,
but it was only one kilometre from the ring road. The site itself was bordered to the north by a 033
canal which had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials when the area was used
for manufacturing.
The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge
was the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance.
To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was
as yet unknown, he decided to create a building centred around the idea of a mystery something whose meaning still has to be discovered.
So how was this reflected in the design of the building? Well, Harrison decided to create
pedestrian access to the building and to make use of the presence of water on the site. 8§..
people approach the entrance they therefore have to cross over a bridge. He wanted to
give people a feeling of suspense as they see the building first from a distance, and then
close-up, and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a
whole was that of a box. The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat
wall uninterrupted by any windows. This might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison's
concept of the buildin g - that the person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be
inside. And this flat wall also has another purpose. At night-time. projectors are swjtc hed on
and it functions asa huge screen. onto which images are projected.

112

034
035

036

Test3
The auditorium itself seats 1500 people. The floor's supported by ten massive pads.
These are constructed from rubber, and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside
and prevent them from affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of
honey-coloured wood, all sourced from local beech trees. In order to improve the acoustic
properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound, they are not straight they are curved .
The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of orchestra and the type of music
being played. In order to achieve this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the
orchestra which are all individually motorized. and the wall s also have curta ins whjc h can be
opened or closed to ch ange the acoust ics.

037

038
039

The reaction of the public to the new building has generally been positive . However t he
040
evaluatio n of some critics has bee n less ent h us iastic . In sp ite of Harrison's efforts to use local
material s. they cri tic ise the style of t he des ign as being internatio n al rather than loca l, and
say it doesn't reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built.

Good morning. This is Burnham tourist office, Martin speaking.
Oh, hello. I saw a poster about free things to do in the area. and it said people should
phone you for information. I'm coming to Burnham with my husband and two children
for a few days on June the 27th, or possibly the 28th, and I'd like some ideas for
things to do o n the 29th.
Yes, of course. OK. Then let's start with a couple of events especially for children.
The art gallery is holding an event called 'Family Welcome' that day, when there are
activities and trails to use throughout the gallery.
That sounds interesting. What time does it start?
The gallery opens at 10, and the 'Famjly Welcome' event run s from 10.30 until 2
�- The gallery stays open until 5. And several times during the day, �
going to sh ow ashort film t h at t he ga llery h as produced. It demonstrates how
ceramics are made, and there'll be equipment and materials for children to have a go
themselve�. Last time they ran the event, there was a film about painting, which went
down very well with the children, and they're now working on one about sculpture.
I like the sound of that. And what other events happen in Burnham?
Well, do you all enjoy listening to music?
Oh, yes.
Well there are several free concerts taking place at different times - one or two in the
morning, the majodty at lvnchtjme, and a couple in the evening. And they range from
pop music to Latin American.
The Latin American could be fun. What time is that?
It's being repeated several times, in different places. They're performing in the central
library at 1 o'clock. then at 4 it's in the City Museu m, and in the evening, at 7.30,
there's a longer concert, in the theatre.
Right. I'll suggest that to the rest of the family.
Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.
Oh, yes, do tell me about that.
The race starts at Offord Marina, to the north of Burnham, and goes as far as
Summer Pool. The best place to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that
does get rather crowded.

Well, local boat clubs, but the standard is very high. One of th em ca me first in the W est
of England regjonal champjonshjp io May this year - it was the first time a team from
Burnham has won. It means that next year they'll be representing the region in the national
championship.
Now I've heard something about Paxton Nature Reserve. It'sa good p!ace for spotting unusual
birds jsn't it?
That's right - throughout the year. There is a lake there, as well as a river, and they provide
a very attractive habitat. So it's a good idea to bring binoculars if you have them. And just at
the moment you can see various flowers t hat are pretty unusua l - the soil at Paxton isn't very
common. They're looking good right now.
Right. My husband will be particularly interested in that.
And there 's go ing to bea talk a nd slide s how about mus hrooms - and you'll be able to go out
and pick some afterwar ds and study the different v ariet ies.
Uhuh. And is it possible for children to swim in the river?
Yes. Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for children to swim jn. It's very shallow. and
there's a lifeguard on duty whenever it's open. The lake is too deep, so swimming isn't allowed
there.
OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton. How long does
it take to get there by car from Burnham?
About 20 minutes, but parking is very limited, so it's usually much easier to go by bus - and it
takes about the same time.
Right. Well, I'll discuss the options with the rest of the family. Thanks very much for all your help.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Bye.

MAN·
SHONA:

First of all, let me thank you all for coming to this public meeting, to discuss the future of our
town. Our first speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford town council. Shona.
Thank you. First I'll briefly give you some background information, then I'll be asking you for your
comments on developments in the town.
Well, as you don't need me to tell you, Barford has changed a great deal in the last 50 years.
These are some of the main changes.
Fifty years ago, buses linked virtually every part of the town and the neighbouring towns
011
and villages. Most people used them frequently, but not now. because the bys compa nie s
concentrate o n just the routes that attr act most passengers So parts o f the town ar e no longer
served by buses. Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart new ones has had little
impact on passenger numbers. It's sometimes said that bus fares are too high. but in relation to
average incomes. fares are not much higher than they were 50 years ago.
Changes in the road network are affecting the town. The centre was recently closed to traffic on
a trial basis, making it much safer for pedestrians. The impact of this is being measured.�
012
new cyc le paths separat in g bikes from cars io most main ro ads are bejng used tar more t ha n
was expected redycjng traffic and jmprovjng ajrqua!jty. And although the council's attempts to
have a bypass constructed have failed. we haven't given up hope of persuading the government
to change its mind.
Shopping in the town centre has changed over the years. Many of us can remember when the
town was crowded with people going shopping. Numbers have been falling for several years,
despite efforts to attract shoppers. for instance by opening new car parks. Some people combine

Test3
shopping with visits to the town's restaurants and cafes. Most shops are small
013
independent stores, which is good. but many people prefer to use super mark et s
and department stores in nearby large towns as there are so few well -kn own chain
stores here.
Turning now to medical facilities, the town is served by family doctors in several
medical practices - fewer than 50 years ago, but each catering for far more patients.
014
Our hospita l closed 15 years ago , which means journeys to other towns are
unavoidable. On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be.
Employment patterns have changed, along with almost everything else. The number 015
of schools and colleges has increased. mak ing that the main emp l oy ment sector.
Services, such as website design and accountancy, have grown in importance, and
surprisingly, perhaps, manufacturing hasn't seen the decline that has affected it in
other parts of the country.
Now I'll very quickly outline current plans for some of the town's facilities, before
asking for your comments.
As you'll know if you regularly use the car park at the railway station, it's usually full.
The railway company applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey car park,
but that was refus ed. Instead. the com pany has bought some adjoining land and th is
will be used to incr ease the num ber of parking spaces .
The Grand. the old cinema in the high st reet. will close at the end of the year . and
reopen on a di ffer ent site. You've probably seen the building under construction.
The plan is to have three screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large
auditorium in the old cinema.
I expect many of you shop in the indoor market. It's become more and more shabbylooking, and because_of fears about safety, it was threatened with demolition. The
good ne ws is that it will c lose for s ix w eeks to be made saf e and redecorated. and
the impr oved build ing will open in July.
Lots of people use the library, including school and college students who go there to
study. The council has manag ed to secure fund ing to keep the li brary open later into
the ev e ni ng. twice a week . We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant
future, but this is by no means definite.
There's no limit on access to the nature reserve on the edge of town, and this will
continue to be the case. What will change, though, is that the council will no longer
be in charge of the area. In stead it will become the responsib ility of a national body
that administers most nature r eserv es in the cou ntry.
OK, now let me ask you ...

Hello, Helen. Sorry I'm late.
Hi, Jeremy, no problem. Well we'd better work out where we are on our project, I
suppose.
Yeah. I've looked at the drawings you've done for my story, 'The Forest', and I think
they're brilliant - they really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing
it.
I'm glad you like them.
There are just a few suggestions I'd like to make.
Go ahead.
Now, I'm not sure about the drawing of the cave - it's got trees all around it. which is 021
great, but the drawing's a bit too static, isn't it? I think it needs some action.

Yes, there's nothing happening. Perhaps I should add the boy - Malcolm, isn't it? He
would be walking up to it.
Yes, let's have Malcolm in the drawing And what about putting in atiger - the one
that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing
itself.
And the tiger stops in the middle of what it's doing when it sees Malcolm walking
past.
That's a good idea.
OK, I'll have a go at that.
Then there's the drawing of the crowd of men and women dancing They' re just
outsi de the forest, and there's a lot going on.
That's right, you wanted them to be watching a carnival procession, but I thought it
would be too crowded. Do you think it works like this?
Yes, I like what you've done. The only thing is, could you add Malcolm to it, without
changing what's already there.
What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?
Yes, that would be fine.
And do you want him watching the other people?
No, he's been left out of all the fun, so I'd like him to bec ryi ng - that'll contrast nicely
with the next picture, where he's laughing at the clowns in the carnival.
Right, I'll do that.
And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.
1 wasn't too happy with that one. Because they' re supposed to beskating on grass
aren't they?
That's right, and it's frozen over. At the moment it doesn't look quite right.
Mm, I see what you mean. I'll have another go at that.
And I like the woorhats they're wearing. Maybe you could give each of them ascarf.
�
Yeah, that's easy enough. They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest
they're skating really fast.
Mm, great. Well that's all on the drawings.
Right. So you've finished writing your story and I just need to finish illustrating it, and
my story and your drawings are done.

022

023

024

025

02 6

So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to write about in the report that
goes with the stories, and how we're going to divide the work.
Right, Helen.
What do you think about including a section on how we planned the project as a
whole, Jeremy? That's probably quite important.
Yeah. Well, you've had most of the good ideas so f ar. How do you fee l about drafting 02 7
something , then we can go through it together and discuss it?
OK, that seems reasonable. And I could include something on how we came up with
the ideas for our two stories, couldn't I?
Well I've started writing something about that. so why don' t you do the same and we 028
can include the two things.
Right. So what about our interpretation of the stories? Do we need to write about
what we think they show, like the value of helping other people, all that sort of thing?
029
That's going to come up late r isn't it? I think everyone in the class is going to read
each other's stories and come up with their own interpretations which we're aojna to

�Oh, I missed that. So it isn't going to be part of the report at all?

Test3
JEREMY:

HELEN:
JEREMY:

No. But we need to write about the illustrations, because they're an essential
element of children's experience of reading the stories. It's probably easiest for you
to write that section. as you know more about drawing than I do.
Maybe, but I find it quite hard to write about. I'd be happie r if you did it.
OK. So when do you think ...

030

SECTION 4
So what I'm going to talk about to you today is something called Ethnography. This is a type
of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work. It was first developed for use in
anthropology, and it's also been used in sociology and communication studies. So what's it
got to do with business, you may ask. Well, businesses are finding that ethnography can offer
031
them deeper insight i nto the possible needs of customers. either present or futu r e. as we ll as
pr oviding valuable information about their attitudes towards existin g products. And ethnography
can also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want.
Let's look at some examples of how ethnographic research works in business. One team of
researchers did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment. They watched
how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and flour. They saw that
the cooks had to check and recheck the contents, because although the measuring cups
had numbers inside them. the cook s couldn't see these easily. So a new design of cup was
developed to overcome this problem, and it was a top seller.

032

Another team of ethnographic researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda,
in Africa. They found that people who didn't have their own phones could pay to use the
phones of local entrepreneurs. Because these customers paid in advance for their calls, th.e:x:_ 033
were eager to know how much time th ey'd spent on the call so far. So the phone company
designed phones for use globally with this added feature.
Ethnographic research has also been carried out in computer companies. In one company, IT
systems administrators were observed for several weeks. It was found that a large amount of
their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that th.e:x:_ 034
didn't havea standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on. So the
team came up with an idea for software that would help them to do this.
In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals.
This led to the re co gnition that the nur ses needed to access the computer recor ds of the ir
patients. no matter where they were. This led to the development of a portable computer
tablet that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.

035

Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can't be
present. For example, in one project done for an airline, respondents used their smartphones 036
to record inf ormation during airline trips. in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of
pa ss eng ers during a flight.
So what makes studies like these different from ordinary research? Let's look at some of the
general principles behind ethnographic research in business. First of all, the researcher has to
be completely open-minded - he or she hasn't thought up a hypothesis to be tested, as is the
case in other types of research. Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform
them. As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that's not really all that
different from ordinary research - the criteria according to which the participants are chosen
may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into, or the researc hers may select
them according to their income, or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular

037

117

Audioscripts
product, for example. But it's absolutely crucial to recruit the right people as participants. As well
as the criteria I've mentioned, they ha ve to becomf ortable talking about themselv es and being 038
watched as they go about the ir actiyjtjes. Actually, most researchers say that people open up
pretty easily, maybe because they're often in their own home or workplace.
So what makes this type of research special is that it's not just a matter of sending a
questionnaire to the participants, instead the researc h is usually based on first-hand
039
observat ion of what t hey are dojna at the t ime. But that doesn't mean that the researcher
never talks to the participants. However, unlike in traditional research, in this case it's the
participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow.
This means that there's less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the
participant.
But after they've said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office, the
researchers' work isn't finished. Most researchers est imate that 70 to 80 per cent of their
time is spent n ot on t he collecting of data but on i ts a na lys is - looki ng at photos, li stening to
recordings a nd t ranscribing them, and so on. The researchers may end up with hundreds
of pages of notes. And to determine what's significant, they don't focus on the sensational
things or the unusual things, instead they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data,
and to discern the meaning behind it. This can result in some compelling insights that can in
turn feed back to the whole design process.

Good morning. Stretton Festival box office. How can I help you?
Oh, hello. My family and I are on holiday in the area, and we've seen some posters
about the festival this week. Could you tell me about some of the events, please?
Of course.
First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?
There are, but only ill. The £12 seats have all been sold.
OK. And the venue is the school, isn't it?
Y es, that's right, the secondary school. Make sure you don't go to the primary school
by mistake! And there's an additional performer who isn't mentioned on the posters
- Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band.
Oh, I think I've heard her on the radio. Doesn't she play the oboe, or flute or
something?
Yes the flute. She usually plays with symphony orchestras, and apparently this is
her first time with a jazz band.
Well, I'd certainly like to hear her. Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck
races - I saw a poster beside a river. What are they, exactly?
Well, you buy a yellow plastic duck - or as many as you like - they're a pound each.
And you write your name on each one. There'll be several races, depending on the
number of ducks taking part. And John Stevens, a champion swimmer who lives
locally, is going to start the races. All the ducks will be l aunched int o t he rjyer at the
back of the cinema, then they'll float along the river for 500 metres, as far as the
railway bridge.
And are there any prizes?

Yes, the first duck in each ra ce to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner free
tickets for the concert on the last night of the festival.
You said you can buy a duck? I'm sure my children will both want one.
They're on sale at a stall in the market . You can't miss it - it's got an enormous sign 05
showing a couple of ducks.
OK. I'll go there this afternoon. I remember walking past there yesterday. Now could
you tell me something about the flower show, please?
Well, admission is free, and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall.
06
Sorry, how do you spell that?
B-Y-T-H-W-A-1-T-E. Bythwaite.
Is it easy to find? I'm not very familiar with the town yet.
Oh, you won't have any problem. It's right in the centre of Stretton. It's the only old
building in the town, so it's easy to recognise.
I know it. I presume it's open all day.
Yes, but if you'd like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers, you'll
need to be there at 5 o'clock. The prizes are being given by a famous actor, Kevin
07
Shapless. He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.
Gosh, I've seen him on TV. I'll definitely go to the prize-giving.
Right.
I've seen a list of plays that are being performed this week, and I'd like to know
which are suitable for my children, and which ones my husband and I might go to.
How old are your children?
Five and seven. What about 'The Mystery of Muldoon'?
That's aimed at five to ten-year-olds.
So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?
I think so. If you'd like something for yourself and your husband and leave your
children with a babysitter you might like to see 'Fire and Flood' - it's about events
that really happened in Stratton two hundred years ago, and children might find it
rather frightening.
Oh, thanks for the warning. And finally, what about 'Silly Sailor'?
That's a comedy, and it's for young and old. In fact, it won an award in the Stretton
Drama Festival a couple of months ago.
OK. Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information. I'm looking forward to the
festival!
Goodbye·.

SECTION 2
Good morning, and welcome to the museum - one with a remarkable range of exhibits, which
I'm sure you'll enjoy. My name's Greg, and I'll tell you about the various collections as we go
round. But before we go, let me just give you a taste of what we have here.
Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of twentieth and twenty-first century paintings,
many by very well-known artists. I'm sure you'll recognise several of the paintings. This is the 011
gallery that att racts the largest number of visitors, so it's best to go in early in the day, before
the crowds arrive.
Then there are the nineteenth-century paintings. The museum was opened in the middle of
that century, and several of the artists each donated one work - to get the museum started,
as it were. So they're of special interest to us - we feel closer to them than to other works.

012

119

Audioscripts
The sculpture gallery has a number of fine exhibits, but I'm afraid it's currently closed for
refurbishment. You'll need to come back next year to see it properly, but a number of the
sculptures have been moved to other parts o f the museum .

013

'Around the world ' is a tempo rary exh ib ition -you ' ve probably seen something about it onTV 014
or in the newspapers. It's created a great deal of interest, because it presents objects from
every continent and many countries, and provides information about their social context why they were made, who for, and so on.
Then there's the collection of coins. This is what you might call a focused, specialist
collection, because all the coins come from this country, and were produced between two
thousand and a thousand years ago. And many of them were discovered by ordinary people
digging their gardens and donated to the museum!
All ou r porcelain and glass was l eft to the museum by its founder, when he died in 1878. And
in the terms of his will, we're not allowed to add anything to that collection: he believed it was
perfect in itself. and we don't see any reason to disagree!

015
016

OK, that was something about the collections, and now here's some more practical
information, in case you need it. Most of the museum facilities are downstairs. in the
basement, so you go down the stairs here. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll
find yourself in a sitting area, with comfortable chairs and sofas where you can have a rest
before continuing your exploration of the museum.
We have a very good restaurant, which serves excellent food all day, in a relaxing
atmosphere. To reach it when you ge t to the bottom of the stairs go str aight ahead to the far
l see the door of the restaurant
side of the sitting area, then tu m right into the corridor. You 'l
facing you.
If you just want a snack, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with facilities for children, we also
have a cafe. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you' ll need to go straight ahead tu rn
rig ht int o the corridor, a nd the cafe is immediately on the right.

017

01 B

And talking about children, there a re bab y-changing facilities down stairs· cross the s itting
ar ea cont inue str aight ahead along the corridor on the left, and you and your baby will find
the facilities on the left-hand side.

019

The cloakroom, wher e you should lea ve coats umbrell as and any large bags is on the left
han d side of the ·sitting area, It's through the last door be fore you come to the corridor.

020

There are toilets on every floor, but in the basement they're the first rooms on the left when
you get down there.
OK, now if you've got anything to leave in the cloakroom, please do that now, and then we'll
start our tour.

SECTION 3
SUPERVISOR:

JOANNA:

120

Hi, Joanna, good to meet you. Now, before we discuss your new research
project, I'd like to hear something about the psychology study you did last year
for your Master's degree. So how did you choose your subjects for that?
Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female. Three were
violinists and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player. They
were all very highly regarded in the music world and they'd done quite ext ensjye 021 & 22
tours in diffe r ent continents, and quite a few had won prizes and competitions
as well.

Test4
SUPERVISOR: And they were quite young, weren't they?
JOANNA:
Yes, between 25 and 29 - the mean was 27.8. I wasn't specifically lookin g for
artists who'd produced recordings. but thjs js something that's just taken for
granted these days and they all had.
SUPERVISOR: Right. Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn't you?
JOANNA:
Yes. 1 r ea li sed if I was gojn g to jnterview l eadin g m us icjans it'd only be possible
over the phone because t hey' r e so busy. I recorded them using a telephone
recording adaptor. I'd been worried about the quality, but it worked out all
right. I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes
longer.
SUPERVISOR: Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?
JOANNA:
I'd thought it might ... it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed
very keen to talk. And I don't think us in g t he pho ne meant I got less ri ch data
r ather the opposi te in f act.
SUPERVISOR: Interesting. And you were looking at how performers dress for concert
performances?
That's right My research investigated the way players see their role as a
JOANNA:
musician and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear. But
that focus didn't emerge immediately. When I star ted I was more interested in
tryi ng to investigate t he impact of what was worn on those listening , and also
whethe r someone like a violinist might adopt a d iffe r ent style of clothi ng from.
say. someone p layjng the flute or the trumpet.
SUPERVISOR: It's interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn't it?
JOANNA:
Yes, you'd expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that's quite rare.

021 & 22

023 & 24

023 & 24

025 & 26
025 & 26

suPERv1soR: You only had wQTTien performers in your study. Was that because male
musicians are less worried about fashion?
JOANNA:
I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion, but jn socia l te rms 027
the choices they have are more limited .• they'd r ea lly upset audiences if they
str ayed away from qu ite na rr ow boundaries.
SUPERVISOR: Hmm. Now, popular music has quite different expectations. Did you read Mike
Frost's article about the dress of women performers in popular music?
JOANNA:
No.
SUPERVISOR: He points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to
dress down in performances, and wear less feminine clothes, like jeans instead
of skirts, and he suggests this is because otherwise they'd just be d iscounted as 02 8
trivia l.
But you could argue they're just wearing what's practical ... I mean, a pop-music
JOANNA:
concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.
suPERv1soR: Yes, he doesn't make that point, but I think you're probably right. I was
interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came
to the choice of dress.
JOANNA:
The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important. It's all to do with what
029
we understand by performance as a public event. They believed the audien ce
had certain expectations a nd it was up to them as performe rs to fulfil these
expectations. to showa kind of esteem ...
SUPERVISOR: ... they weren't afraid of looking as if they'd made an effort to look good.
JOANNA:
Mmm. I think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of
one another too, but that's not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.
SUPERVISOR: No.
JOANNA:
And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to
clothing.

121

Audioscripts
SUPERVISOR: Musicians are quite vulnerable physically, aren't they, because the movements
they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so I' d imag ine some f ea tures
030
of sports clothing could safegua rd the players from t he potentiall y dangerous
effects of this sort of thing .
JOANNA:
Yes, but musicians don't really consider it. They avoid clothing that obviously
restricts their movements, but that's as far as they go.
suPERv1soR: Anyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you're
going from here?
I was thinking of doing a study using an audience, including ...
JOANNA:

SECTION 4
As we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last century. If we could reduce the amount of
C02, perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down. One potential method
involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in, with regard to absorbing C0 2.
Rattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA, claims that the world's
agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- the equivalent of the amount released in the last 30 years. And research is going on into
how this might be achieved.
Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in
climate change, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.
Carbon-rich soil is dark, crumbly and fertile, and retains some water. But erosion can occu r
031
if so il is dry. which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of carbon. Erosion is
of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain. In the 1970s
and ·aos, Lal was studying so ils in Africa so devoid of o rgani c matter th at the ground had
032
beco me extremely hard, like cement. There he met a pioneer in the study of global warming,
who suggested that carbon from the soil had moved into the atmosphere. This is now looking
increasingly likely.
Let me explain. For millions of years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been
regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and microbes - tiny organisms in
the soil. Plants absorb C02 from the a ir and transform it int o suga rs a nd ot h er carbon-based
substances . While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant, some tran sfer
fr om the roots to fungi a nd so il microbes , which store the carbon in the soil.

033
034

The invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago disrupted these ancient soil-building
processes and led to the loss of carbon from the soil. When humans started draining the
natural topsoil, and ploughing it up for planting, they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen.
This created carbon dioxide and released it into the air. And in some places, grazing by
domesticated animals has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air. Tons of
carbon have been stripped from the world's soils - where it's needed - and pumped into the
atmosphere.
So what can be done? Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest
changes to farming can significantly help to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative agriculture.
035
This a ims to boost the fertility of soi! a nd keep it moist through establish ed practices. These
036
include keeping fields planted all year round, and increasing the variety o f plants being
grown. Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil,
so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.

122

Test4
One American investigation into the potential for storing C02 on agricultural lands is taking
place in California. Soil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is
conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large cattle farm in the state. She and her students
are testing the effects on carbon storage of the compost that is created from waste - both
agricultural, including manure and cornstalks. and waste produced jn gardens , such as
leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.
In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment
strategy. Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil carbon by cultiyatjn g grasses
that stay green all year round. Like composting, the approach has already been proved
experimentally; Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that
the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured.
It's hoped in the future that projects such as these will demonstrate the role that farmers
and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.
For example, in countries like the United States, where most farming operations use large
applications of fertiliser, changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.
Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive payment not just for the corn or beef they
produce but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.

TEST 1, WRITING TASK 1
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 4.5 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
The candidate covers all the data in the charts, but there is some inaccuracy in his
description (the largest percentage went with the Agricultural and farms) ( not true
in all cases) and there is a shortage of data to support the descriptions. There is an
attempt to summarise the main points at the end of the description. Information is
evident, but it is not arranged coherently(the description jumps from different usage
in general to specific use in different countries, but this does not follow a logical
sequence). Without reference back to the individual charts, it is hard to follow the
descri ption, especially where reference is also unclear (it, them, they). The range
of lexis is just adequate for the task (largest percentage, greatest number, a lot, the
second after Asia), but there is reliance on input material and errors in spelling are
noticeable, even where the lexis is supplied in the prompt or the diagrams. A very
limited range of structures is used and grammatical errors are frequent( ... all of pie
charls have the got . . . , . . . they almost the second after Asia use water in industrial
and opposite of Europe, . . . they slightly same in industrial use, . . . South Asia and
South America are uses the water in Agricultural rather than industrial). The script
represents a mixed profile, but overall achieves Band 4.5.

TEST 1, WRITING TASK 2
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.5 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
The candidate puts forward three reasons for why he agrees with the statement
and develops/supports the first two of these. Further support and development
would be necessary to achieve a higher score here. Organisation is evident,
with some simple cohesive devices (sometimes used inaccurately) (First of

all, Nowaday, At the same time, Secondly, This, However, It, Finally, Overall),

and there are attempts to use paragraphs to present ideas. The range of lexis
is generally adequate and appropriate (pollution, driving to work, rush hours,

emissions, environment, traffic jam, congestion, public transport, commute,
destinations, advantages, drawbacks) and although there are spelling errors, these
do not usually impede communication. The candidate attempts to use complex
sentences (relative clauses, if clauses), but error levels are high and there are also
quite frequent errors in punctuation.

TEST 2, WRITING TASK 1
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
The candidate covers all the key features of the task and rounds off the description
with an overview. There is some repetition of information and some irrelevant
commentary (which is good because it shows that more people have learned other
languages well). Information is arranged coherently and there is a clear overall
progression, with effective use of cohesive devices, though there is a tendency
to rely on dates. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the task, but the writer
does not attempt any less common items. There is a mix of simple and complex
sentence forms, with a fair degree of accuracy, but the range would need to be
wider to achieve a higher score.

TEST 2, WRITING TASK 2
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
The candidate expresses a position, but only partially addresses the prompt
(he or she considers ways in which people can be encouraged to recycle, rather
than explicitly looking at the extent to which laws are required); however, ideas
are relevant and are supported with clear examples. There is a clear overall
progression and cohesive devices are used effectively, if somewhat mechanically
(apart from Either). Paragraphing is just adequate. Lexical range is adequate for
the task and there are attempts to use less common items (policy, junk bank,
citizen. deposit), but there are errors in word formation (sale/sell, growth/grow up)
and some errors in word choice cause difficulty for the reader (inverse to be some
money, motivate advantages of recycling). There are attempts to use complex
sentence structures, but grammatical errors are frequent (million tons of wastes
have been being produced which from home everyday, easy example way to do in
house, There is one day a week in order that clean school together which help they
have ... , Starting give education).

TEST 3, WRITING TASK 1
SAMPLE ANSWER

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
The candidate has reported all the data in the graph and provides summaries of
the main trends ( The production of carbon dioxide in Portugal and Italy was steadily
increasing during that period, The emission of carbon dioxide in United Kingdom
and Sweden was under decrease during that period of time). There are attempts
at comparison ( The emission of carbon dioxide in United Kingdom in 1967 was
the highest one among all these 4 countries, In 2007 the emission in Sweden was
at the same level with Portugal), but there is some irrelevant material in the final

paragraph. There is a clear overall progression, with some use of cohesive devices

(However, in the beginning). The range of lexis is adequate and appropriate for the
task (production of carbon dioxide, a bit higher, increased, decreased) and although
there are some errors in word choice (was under decrease, underwent/continued)
and spelling (tones/tonnes, deacrease), these do not prevent the message from

coming across. There are some attempts to produce complex sentence forms, with
good control over grammatical accuracy.

SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 7 score. Here is the

All parts of the prompt are addressed and a clear position is presented throughout
the response. Main ideas are extended and supported. Ideas are logically
organised and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A range of
cohesive devices is used flexibly, while each paragraph has a clear central topic
which is developed. The lexical resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and

overall clarity of the response. A variety of complex structures is used with some
flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are well controlled and error-free
sentences are frequent.

TEST 4, WRITING TASK 1
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 7 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
The candidate covers the main features of the table and charts, and gives a
satisfactory overview of the data. The information is logically organised with a
clear progression in the way points are presented. Cohesive devices are used
effectively (during the same two periods), but not always accurately (on a contrary).
A range of vocabulary is used flexibly (shows a negative pattern, illustrates that,
an upward trend, has reached its aim), but there are occasional errors in word
choice (the amount of visitors, It is obviously). The candidate has used a variety of
complex structures (the charts that show the result of surveys asking people how
satisfied they were with their visit, after the refurbishment from 74,000 before the
reconstruction to 92,000 after it had been done). There is good control of grammar,
although there are a few minor errors (there is the charts). Punctuation is generally
well controlled, but full stops are missing at the end of the first and final paragraphs
and there are a few minor errors (lets look).

TEST 4, WRITING TASK 2
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.5 score. Here is the
examiner's comment:
All parts of the prompt are addressed and a position is presented (eventually)
that is directly relevant to the prompt. Main ideas are relevant, but some are
insufficiently developed. Ideas are generally arranged coherently and there
is a clear overall progression. Some cohesive devices are used effectively, if
mechanically, while others are faulty (From the point of my view). Paragraphing
is adequate. The lexical resource is limited, but just about adequate for the task.
Errors occur in word choice, word formation and spelling (rise satisfaction, the
same important as economic for a country, morden) and may cause some difficulty
for the reader. The candidate has tried to use a variety of complex structures, but
the writing lacks grammatical control (we are going to talking about, A country
doesn't have a completed systems is not a completed country ... ). The variety of
structures would suggest Band 6 on Grammar, Range and Accuracy, but the errors
sometimes impede communication; there are also errors in sentence formation and/
or punctuation (But some people argue that, So the goverments put the economic
progress to the top list, Because there are other progress such as).
