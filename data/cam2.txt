Introduction

HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES?
In the Answer key at the end of the each set of Listening and Reading answers you will find
a chart which will help you assess if, on the basis of your practice test results, you are ready
to take the IELTS exam.
In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind.
Your performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band
Score from 1 to 9 for each of the modules and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which is
the average of your scores in the four modules.
However, institutions considering your application are advised to look at both the Overall
Band and the Bands for each module. They do this in order to see if you have the language
skills needed for a particular course of study. For example, if your course has a lot of
reading and writing, but no lectures, listening comprehension might be less important and a
score of 5 in Listening might be acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a
course where there are lots of lectures and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening
might be unacceptable even though the Overall Band Score was 7.
Once you have marked your papers you should have some idea of whether your Listening
and Reading skills are good enough for you to try the real IELTS test. If you did well
enough in one module but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are
ready to take the proper test yet.
The Practice Tests have been checked so that they are about the same level of difficulty as
the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the Practice Test
papers will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you an idea of
your possible future performance and it is ultimately up to you to make decisions based on
your score.
Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have
based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept.
The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score
than most other institutions.
Sample answers or model answers are provided for the Writing tasks. The sample answers
were written by IELTS candidates; each answer has been given a band score and the
candidate's performance is described. Please note that the examiner's guidelines for marking
the Writing scripts are very detailed. There are many different ways a candidate may achieve
a particular band score. The model answers were written by an examiner as examples of very
good answers, but it is important to understand that they are just one example out of many
possible approaches.

Between them, these two

granite make up a quarter of
the new island's surface area.
Unfortunately, between the
islands there was a layer of soft
mud, 27 metres thick in places.
According
to
Frans
Uiterwijk, a Dutchman who is
the
project's
reclamation
director, it would have been
possible to leave this mud
below the reclaimed land, and
to deal with the resulting
settlement by the Kansai
method. But the consortium

aggressive approach.
It
assembled the worlds largest
fleet of dredgers, which sucked
up l50m cubic metres of clay
and mud and dumped it in
deeper waters. At the same
time, sand was dredged from
the waters and piled on top of
the layer of stiff clay that the
massive dredging had laid bare.
Nor was the sand the only
thing used. The original granite
island which had hills up to 120
metres high was drilled and
blasted into boulders no bigger
than two metres in diameter.
This provided 70m cubic
metres of granite to add to the
island's foundations. Because
the heap of boulders does not
fill the space perfectly, this
represents the equivalent of
105m cubic metres of landfill.
Most of the rock will become
the foundations for
the

airport's runways and its
taxiways. The sand dredged
from the waters will also be
used to provide a two-metre
capping layer over the granite
platform. This makes it easier
for utilities to dig trenches granite is unyielding stuff. Most
of the terminal buildings will
be placed above the site of the
existing island. Only a limited
amount of pile-driving is
needed to support building
foundations above softer areas.
The completed island will be

overloads, has to be moved

Changing our
Understanding of Health
A
The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and
groups. These meanings of health have also changed over time. This change
is no more evident than in Western society today, when notions of health and
health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways.
B
For much of recent Western history, health has been viewed in the physical
sense only. That is, good health has been connected to the smooth
mechanical operation of the body, while ill health has been attributed to a
breakdown in this machine. Health in this sense has been defined as the
absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms. According to this
view, creating health for people means providing medical care to treat or
prevent disease and illness. During this period, there was an emphasis on
providing clean water, improved sanitation and housing.

C
In the late 1940s the World Health Organisation challenged this physically and
medically oriented view of health. They stated that 'health is a complete state
of physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the absence of
disease' (WHO, 1946). Health and the person were seen more holistically
(mind/body/spirit) and not just in physical terms.
D
The 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by
emphasising the importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual.
Specific behaviours which were seen to increase risk of disease, such as
smoking, lack of fitness and unhealthy eating habits, were targeted. Creating
health meant providing not only medical health care, but health promotion
programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours
and lifestyles. While this individualistic healthy lifestyles approach to health
worked for some (the wealthy members of society), people experiencing
poverty, unemployment, underemployment or little control over the
conditions of their daily lives benefited little from this approach. This was
largely because both the healthy lifestyles approach and the medical
approach to health largely ignored the social and environmental conditions
affecting the health of people.

E
During
1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from
seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health. While lifestyle factors
still remain important, health is being viewed also in terms of the social,
economic and environmental contexts in which people live. This broad
approach to health is called the socio-ecological view of health. The broad
socio-ecological view of health was endorsed at the first International
Conference of Health Promotion held in 1986, Ottawa, Canada, where people
from 38 countries agreed and declared that:
The fundamental conditions and resources for health are
peace, shelter, education, food, a viable income, a stable
eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.
Improvement in health requires a secure foundation in
these basic requirements. (WHO, 1986)
It is clear from this statement that the creation of health is about much more
than encouraging healthy individual behaviours and lifestyles and providing
appropriate medical care. Therefore, the creation of health must include
addressing issues such as poverty, pollution, urbanisation, natural resource
depletion, social alienation and poor working conditions. The social, economic
and environmental contexts which contribute to the creation of health do not
operate separately or independently of each other. Rather, they are interacting
and interdependent, and it is the complex interrelationships between them
which determine the conditions that promote health. A broad socio-ecological
view of health suggests that the promotion of health must include a strong
social, economic and environmental focus.

F
At the Ottawa Conference in 1986, a charter was developed which outlined
new directions for health promotion based on the socio-ecological view of
health. This charter, known as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion,
remains as the backbone of health action today. In exploring the scope of
health promotion it states that:
Good health is a major resource for social, economic and
personal development and an important dimension of
quality of life. Political, economic, social, cultural,
environmental, behavioural and biological factors can all
favour health or be harmful to it. (WHO, 1986)
The Ottawa Charter brings practical meaning and action to this broad notion
of health promotion. It presents fundamental strategies and approaches in
achieving health for all. The overall philosophy of health promotion which
guides these fundamental strategies and approaches is one of 'enabling
people to increase control over and to improve their health' (WHO, 1986).

below

CHILDREN'S THINKING
One of the
most
eminent
of
psychologists, Clark Hull, claimed that
the essence of reasoning lies in the
putting together of two 'behaviour
segments' in some novel way, never
actually performed before, so as to
reach a goal.
Two followers of Clark Hull, Howard
and Tracey Kendler, devised a test for
children that was explicitly based on
Clark Hull's principles. The children
were given the task of learning to
operate a machine so as to get a toy. In
order to succeed they had to go through
a two-stage sequence. The children
were trained on each stage separately.
The stages consisted merely of pressing
the correct one of two buttons to get a
marble; and of inserting the marble into
a small hole to release the toy.
The Kendlers found that the children
could learn the separate bits readily
enough. Given the task of getting a
marble by pressing the button they
could get the marble; given the task of
getting a toy when a marble was handed
to them, they could use the marble. (All
they had to do was put it in a hole.) But
they did not for the most part
'integrate', to use the Kendlers'
terminology. They did not press the
button to get the marble and then
proceed without further help to use the
marble to get the toy. So the Kendlers
concluded that they were incapable of
deductive reasoning.

The mystery at first appears to
deepen when we learn, from another
psychologist, Michael Cole, and his
colleagues, that adults in an African
culture apparently cannot do the
Kendlers' task either. But it lessens, on
the other hand, when we learn that a
task was devised which was strictly
analogous to the Kendlers' one but
much easier for the African males to
handle.
Instead of the button-pressing
machine, Cole used a locked box and
two differently coloured match-boxes,
one of which contained a key that
would open the box. Notice that there
are still two behaviour segments —
'open the right match-box to get the key'
and 'use the key to open the box' - so
the task seems formally to be the same.
But psychologically it is quite different,
Now the subject is dealing not with a
strange machine but with familiar
meaningful objects; and it is clear to
him what he is meant to do. It then
turns out that the difficulty of
'integration' is greatly reduced,
Recent work by Simon Hewson is of
great interest here for it shows that, for
young children, too, the difficulty lies
not in the inferential processes which
the task demands, but in certain
perplexing features of the apparatus
and the procedure. When these are
changed in ways which do not at all
affect the inferential nature of the

problem, then five-year-old children
solve the problem as well as college
students did in the Kendlers' own
experiments.
Hewson made two crucial changes.
First, he replaced the button-pressing
mechanism in the side panels by
drawers in these panels which the child
could open and shut. This took away
the mystery from the first stage of
training. Then he helped the child to
understand that there was no 'magic'
about the specific marble which, during
the second stage of training, the
experimenter handed to him so that he
could pop it in the hole and get the
reward.
A child understands nothing, after
all, about how a marble put into a hole
can open a little door. How is he to
know that any other marble of similar

size will do just as well? Yet he must
assume that if he is to solve the
problem. Hewson made the functional
equivalence of different marbles clear
by playing a 'swapping game' with the
children.
The two modifications together
produced a jump in success rates from
30 per cent to 90 per cent for five-yearolds and from 35 per cent to 72.5 per
cent for four-year-olds. For three-yearolds, for reasons that are still in need of
clarification, no improvement — rather a
slight drop in performance - resulted
from the change.
We may conclude, then, that
children experience very real difficulty
when faced with the Kendler
apparatus; but this difficulty cannot be
taken as proof that they are incapable of
deductive reasoning.

IMPLEMENTING THE CYCLE OF SUCCESS:
A CASE STUDY
Within Australia, Australian Hotels Inc
(AHI) operates nine hotels and employs over
2000 permanent full-time staff, 300
permanent part-time employees and 100
casual staff. One of its latest ventures, the
Sydney Airport hotel (SAH), opened in
March 1995. The hotel is the closest to
Sydney Airport and is designed to provide
the best available accommodation, food and
beverage and meeting facilities in Sydney's
southern suburbs. Similar to many
international hotel chains, however, AHI has
experienced difficulties in Australia in
providing long-term profits for hotel owners,
as a result of the country's high labour-cost
structure. In order to develop an
economically viable hotel organisation
model, AHI decided to implement some new
policies and practices at SAH.
The first of the initiatives was an
organisational structure with only three
levels of management - compared to the
traditional seven. Partly as a result of this
change, there are 25 per cent fewer
management positions, enabling a
significant saving. This change also has
other implications. Communication, both up
and down the organisation, has greatly
improved. Decision-making has been forced
down in many cases to front-line employees.
As a result, guest requests are usually met
without reference to a supervisor, improving
both customer and employee satisfaction.
The hotel also recognised that it would
need a different approach to selecting

employees who would fit in with its new
policies. In its advertisements, the hotel
stated a preference for people with some
'service' experience in order to minimise
traditional work practices being introduced
into the hotel. Over 7000 applicants filled in
application forms for the 120 jobs initially
offered at SAH. The balance of the positions
at the hotel (30 management and 40 shift
leader positions) were predominantly filled
by transfers from other AHI properties.
A series of tests and interviews were
conducted with potential employees, which
eventually left 280 applicants competing for
the 120 advertised positions. After the final
interview, potential recruits were divided
into three categories. Category A was for
applicants exhibiting strong leadership
qualities, Category C was for applicants
perceived to be followers, and Category B
was for applicants with both leader and
follower qualities. Department heads and
shift leaders then composed prospective
teams using a combination of people from
all three categories. Once suitable teams
were formed, offers of employment were
made to team members.
Another major initiative by SAH was to
adopt a totally multi-skilled workforce.
Although there may be some limitations
with highly technical jobs such as cooking
or maintenance, wherever possible,
employees at SAH are able to work in a
wide variety of positions. A multi-skilled
workforce provides far greater management

The most crucial way, however, of
improving the labour cost structure at SAH
was to find better, more productive ways of
providing customer service. SAH
management concluded this would first
require a process of 'benchmarking'. The
prime objective of the benchmarking process
was to compare a range of service delivery
processes across a range of criteria using
teams made up of employees from different
departments within the hotel which
interacted with each other. This process
resulted in performance measures that
greatly enhanced SAH's ability to
improve productivity and quality.
The front office team discovered through
this project that a high proportion of AHI
Club member reservations were incomplete.
As a result, the service provided to these
guests was below the standard promised to
them as part of their membership agreement.
Reducing the number of incomplete
reservations greatly improved
guest perceptions of service.

In addition, a program modelled on an
earlier project called 'Take Charge' was
implemented. Essentially, Take Charge
provides an effective feedback loop from
both customers and employees. Customer
comments, both positive and negative, are
recorded by staff. These are collated
regularly to identify opportunities for
improvement. Just as importantly,
employees are requested to note down their
own suggestions for improvement. (AHI has
set an expectation that employees will
submit at least three suggestions for every
one they receive from a customer.)
Employee feedback is reviewed daily and
suggestions are implemented within 48
hours, if possible, or a valid reason is given
for non-implementation. If suggestions
require analysis or data collection, the Take
Charge team has 30 days in which to address
the issue and come up with
recommendations.
Although quantitative evidence of AHI's
initiatives at SAH are limited at present,
anecdotal evidence clearly suggests that
these practices are working. Indeed AHI is
progressively rolling out these initiatives in
other hotels in Australia, whilst numerous
overseas visitors have come to see how the
program works.

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14—26 which are based on Reading Passage 2
below.

speaking countries were by no means
exempt - although the widespread use of
English as an alternative language made
them less open to the charge of

insularity.
The discovery that language can be a
barrier to communication is quickly
made by all who travel, study, govern or
sell. Whether the activity is tourism,
research, government, policing, business,
or data dissemination, the lack of a
common language can severely impede
progress or can halt it altogether.
'Common language' here usually means
a foreign language, but the same point
applies in principle to any encounter
with unfamiliar dialects or styles within a
single language. 'They don't talk the
same language' has a major metaphorical
meaning alongside its literal one.
Although communication problems of
this kind must happen thousands of
times each day, very few become public
knowledge. Publicity comes only when a
failure to communicate has major
consequences, such as strikes, lost orders,
legal problems, or fatal accidents - even,
at times, war. One reported instance of
communication failure took place in
1970, when several Americans ate a
species of poisonous mushroom. No
remedy was known, and two of the
people died within days. A radio report
of the case was heard by a chemist who
knew of a treatment that had been
successfully used in 1959 and published
in 1963. Why had the American doctors
not heard of it seven years later?
Presumably because the report of the
treatment had been published only in
journals written in European languages
other than English.
Several comparable cases have been
reported. But isolated examples do not

give an impression of the size of the
problem — something that can come only
from studies of the use or avoidance of
foreign-language materials and contacts
in different communicative situations. In
the English-speaking scientific world, for
example, surveys of books and
documents consulted in libraries and
other information agencies have shown
that very little foreign-language material
is ever consulted. Library requests in the
field of science and technology showed
that only 13 per cent were for foreign
language periodicals. Studies of the
sources cited in publications lead to a
similar conclusion: the use of foreignlanguage sources is often found to be as
low as 10 per cent.
The language barrier presents itself in
stark form to firms who wish to market
their products in other countries. British
industry, in particular, has in recent
decades often been criticised for its
linguistic insularity — for its assumption
that foreign buyers will be happy to
communicate in English, and that
awareness of other languages is not
therefore a priority. In the 1960s, over
two-thirds of British firms dealing with
• non-English-speaking customers were
using English for outgoing
correspondence; many had their sales
literature only in English; and as many as
40 per cent employed no-one able to
communicate in the customers'
languages. A similar problem was
identified in other English-speaking
countries, notably the USA, Australia
and New Zealand. And non-English-

The criticism and publicity given to
this problem since the 1960s seems to
have greatly improved the situation.
industrial training schemes have
promoted an increase in linguistic and
cultural awareness. Many firms now have
their own translation services; to take just
one example in Britain, Rowntree
Mackintosh now publish their
documents in six languages (English,
French, German, Dutch, Italian and
Xhosa). Some firms run part-time
language courses in the languages of the
countries with which they are most
involved; some produce their own
technical glossaries, to ensure
consistency when material is being
translated. It is now much more readily
appreciated that marketing efforts can be
delayed, damaged, or disrupted by a

failure to take account of the linguistic
needs of the customer.
The changes in awareness have been
most marked in English-speaking
countries, where the realisation has
gradually dawned that by no means
everyone in the world knows English
well enough to negotiate in it. This is
especially a problem when English is not
an official language of public
administration, as in most parts of the
Far East, Russia, Eastern Europe, the
Arab world, Latin America and Frenchspeaking Africa. Even in cases where
foreign customers can speak English
quite well, it is often forgotten that they
may not be able to understand it to the
required level - bearing in mind the
regional and social variation which
permeates speech and which can cause
major problems of listening
comprehension. In securing
understanding, how 'we' speak to 'them'
is just as important, it appears, as how
'they' speak to 'us'.

What Is a Port City?
The port city provides a fascinating and rich understanding of the movement of people
and qoods around the world. We understand a port as a centre of land-sea exchange,
and as a major source of livelihood and a major force for cultural mixing. But do ports
all produce a range of common urban characteristics which justify classifying port cities
toqether under a single generic label? Do they have enough in common to warrant
distinguishing them from other kinds of cities ?
A A port must be distinguished from a harbour. They are two very different things. Most
ports have poor harbours, and many fine harbours see few ships. Harbour is a physical
concept, a shelter for ships; port is an economic concept, a centre of land-sea
exchange which requires good access to a hinterland even more than a sea-linked
foreland. It is landward access, which is productive of goods for export and which
demands imports, that is critical. Poor harbours can be improved with breakwaters and
dredging if there is a demand for a port. Madras and Colombo are examples of
harbours expensively improved by enlarging, dredging and building breakwaters.

Answer

B Port cities become industrial, financial and service centres and political capitals
because of their water connections and the urban concentration which arises there and
later draws to it railways, highways and air routes. Water transport means cheap access,
the chief basis of all port cities. Many of the world's biggest cities, for example,
London, New York, Shanghai, Istanbul, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Jakarta, Calcutta,
Philadelphia and San Francisco began as ports - that is, with land-sea exchange as
their major function - but they have since grown disproportionately in other respects
so that their port functions are no longer dominant. They remain different kinds of
places from non-port cities and their port functions account for that difference.
C Port functions, more than anything else, make a city cosmopolitan. A port city is open
to the world. In it races, cultures, and ideas, as well as goods from a variety of places,
jostle, mix and enrich each other and the life of the city. The smell of the sea and the
harbour, the sound of boat whistles or the moving tides are symbols of their multiple
links with a wide world, samples of which are present in microcosm within their own
urban areas.
D Sea ports have been transformed by the advent of powered vessels, whose size and
draught have increased. Many formerly important ports have become economically
and physically less accessible as a result. By-passed by most of their former enriching
flow of exchange, they have become cultural and economic backwaters or have
acquired the character of museums of the past. Examples of these are Charleston,
Salem, Bristol, Plymouth, Surat, Galle, Melaka, Soochow, and a long list of earlier
prominent port cities in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America.

E

Much domestic port trade has not been recorded. What evidence we have sug3ests
that domestic trade was greater at all periods than external trade. Shanghai, for
example, did most of its trade with other Chinese ports and inland cities. Calcutta
traded mainly with other parts of India and so on. Most of any city's population is
engaged in providing goods and services for the city itself. Trade outside the city is its
basic function. But each basic worker requires food, housing, clothing and other such
services. Estimates of the ratio of basic to service workers range from 1:4 to 1:8.
F No city can be simply a port but must be involved in a variety of other activities. The
port function of the city draws to it raw materials and distributes them in many other
forms. Ports take advantage of the need for breaking up the bulk material where water
and land transport meet and where loading and unloading costs can be minimised by
refining raw materials or turning them into finished goods. The major examples here are
oil refining and ore refining, which are commonly located at ports. It is not easy to
draw a line around what is and is not a port function. All ports handle, unload, sort,
alter, process, repack, and reship most of what they receive. A city may still be
regarded as a port city when it becomes involved in a great range of functions not
immediately involved with ships or docks.

G Cities which began as ports retain the chief commercial and administrative centre of
the city close to the waterfront. The centre of New York is in lower Manhattan between
two river mouths, the City of London is on the Thames, Shanghai along the Bund. This
proximity to water is also true of Boston, Philadelphia, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras,
Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Yokohama, where the commercial, financial, and
administrative centres are still grouped around their harbours even though each city has
expanded into a metropolis. Even a casual visitor cannot mistake them as anything but
port cities.

ABSENTEEISM IN NURSING:
A LONGITUDINAL STUDY
Absence from work is a costly and
disruptive problem for any organisation.
The cost of absenteeism in Australia has
been put at 1.8 million hours per day or
$1400 million annually. The study reported
here was conducted in the Prince William
Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, where, prior
to this time, few active steps had been taken
to measure, understand or manage the
occurrence of absenteeism.
Nursing Absenteeism
A prevalent attitude amongst many nurses
in the group selected for study was that
there was no reward or recognition for not
utilising the paid sick leave entitlement
allowed them in their employment
conditions. Therefore, they believed they
may as well take the days off — sick or
otherwise. Similar attitudes have been
noted by James (1989), who noted that sick
leave is seen by many workers as a right,
like annual holiday leave.
Miller and Norton (1986), in their survey of
865 nursing personnel, found that 73 per
cent felt they should be rewarded for not
taking sick leave, because some employees
always used their sick leave. Further, 67 per
cent of nurses felt that administration was
not sympathetic to the problems shift work
causes to employees' personal and social
lives. Only 53 per cent of the respondents

felt that every effort was made to schedule
staff fairly.
In another longitudinal study of nurses
working in two Canadian hospitals, Hacket
Bycio and Guion (1989) examined the
reasons why nurses took absence from
work. The most frequent reason stated for
absence was minor illness to self. Other
causes, in decreasing order of frequency,
were illness in family, family social
function, work to do at home and
bereavement.
Method
In an attempt to reduce the level of
absenteeism amongst the 250 Registered an
Enrolled Nurses in the present study, the
Prince William management introduced
three different, yet potentially
complementary, strategies over 18 months.
Strategy 1: Non-financial (material)
incentives
Within the established wage and salary
system it was not possible to use hospital
funds to support this strategy. However, it
was possible to secure incentives from loca
businesses, including free passes to
entertainment parks, theatres, restaurants,
etc. At the end of each roster period, the
ward with the lowest absence rate would
win the prize.

needs.
Strategy 3: Individual absenteeism and
Each month, managers would analyse the
pattern of absence of staff with excessive
sick leave (greater than ten days per year for
full-time employees). Characteristic patterns
of potential 'voluntary absenteeism' such as
absence before and after days off, excessive
weekend and night duty absence and
multiple single days off were
communicated to all ward nurses and then,
as necessary, followed up by action.
Results
Absence rates for the six months prior to the
Incentive scheme ranged from 3.69 per cent
to 4.32 per cent. In the following six months
they ranged between 2.87 per cent and 3.96
per cent. This represents a 20 per cent
improvement. However, analysing the
absence rates on a year-to-year basis, the
overall absence rate was 3.60 per cent in the
first year and 3.43 per cent in the following
year. This represents a 5 per cent decrease
from the first to the second year of the
study. A significant decrease in absence
over the two-year period could not be
demonstrated.
Discussion
The non-financial incentive scheme did
appear to assist in controlling absenteeism
in the short term. As the scheme progressed
it became harder to secure prizes and this
contributed to the program's losing
momentum and finally ceasing. There were

mixed results across wards as well. For
example, in wards with staff members who
had long-term genuine illness, there was
little chance of winning, and to some extent
the staff on those wards were
disempowered. Our experience would
suggest that the long-term effects of
incentive awards on absenteeism are
questionable.
Over the time of the study, staff were given
a larger degree of control in their rosters.
This led to significant improvements in
communication between managers and
staff. A similar effect was found from the
implementation of the third strategy. Many
of the nurses had not realised the impact
their behaviour was having on the
organisation and their colleagues but there
were also staff members who felt that
talking to them about their absenteeism was
'picking' on them and this usually had a
negative effect on management—employee
relationships.
Conclusion
Although there has been some decrease in
absence rates, no single strategy or
combination of strategies has had a
significant impact on absenteeism per se.
Notwithstanding the disappointing results,
it is our contention that the strategies were
not in vain. A shared ownership of
absenteeism and a collaborative approach to
problem solving has facilitated improved
cooperation and communication between
management and staff. It is our belief that
this improvement alone, while not tangibly
measurable, has increased the ability of
management to manage the effects of
absenteeism more effectively since this
study.

The Prince William Hospital has been trying to reduce
absenteeism amongst nurses for many years.
Nurses in the Prince William Hospital study believed
that there were benefits in taking as little sick leave as
possible.
Just over half the nurses in the 1986 study believed that
management understood the effects that shift work had
on them.
The Canadian study found that 'illness in the family'
was a greater cause of absenteeism than 'work to do at
home'.

plants, the handkey received its big break when it was used to control
access to the Olympic Village in Atlanta by more than 65,000 athletes,
trainers and support staff. Now there are scores of other applications.

'

A

Students who want to enter the University of Montreal's Athletic
Complex need more than just a conventional ID card - their identities
must be authenticated by an electronic hand scanner. In some California
housing estates, a key alone is insufficient to get someone in the door;
his or her voiceprint must also be verified. And soon, customers at some
Japanese banks will have to present their faces for scanning before they
can enter the building and withdraw their money.

B

All of these are applications of biometrics, a little-known but fast-growing
technology that involves the use of physical or biological characteristics
to identify individuals. In use for more than a decade at some highsecurity government institutions in the United States and Canada,
biometrics are now rapidly popping up in the everyday world. Already,
more than 10,000 facilities, from prisons to day-care centres, monitor
people's fingerprints or other physical parts to ensure that they are who
they claim to be. Some 60 biometric companies around the world pulled
in at least $22 million last year and that grand total is expected to
mushroom to at least $50 million by 1999.

C

)

Biometric security systems operate by storing a digitised record of some
unique human feature. When an authorised user wishes to enter or use
the facility, the system scans the person's corresponding characteristics
and attempts to match them against those on record. Systems using
fingerprints, hands, voices, irises, retinas and faces are already on the
market. Others using typing patterns and even body odours are in
various stages of development.

D

Fingerprint scanners are currently the most widely deployed type of
biometric application, thanks to their growing use over the last 20 years
by law-enforcement agencies. Sixteen American states now use
biometric fingerprint verification systems to check that people claiming
welfare payments are genuine. In June, politicians in Toronto voted to do
the same, with a pilot project beginning next year.

E

To date, the most widely used commercial biometric system is the
handkey, a type of hand scanner which reads the unique shape, size and
irregularities of people's hands. Originally developed for nuclear power

F

Around the world, the market is growing rapidly. Malaysia, for
example, is preparing to equip all of its airports with biometric face
scanners to match passengers with luggage. And Japan's largest maker
of cash dispensers is developing new machines that incorporate iris
scanners. The first commercial biometric, a hand reader used by an
American firm to monitor employee attendance, was introduced in
1974. But only in the past few years has the technology improved
enough for the prices to drop sufficiently to make them commercially
viable. 'When we started four years ago, I had to explain to everyone
what a biometric is,' says one marketing expert. 'Now, there's much
more awareness out there.'

C

Not surprisingly, biometrics raise thorny questions about privacy and the
potential for abuse. Some worry that governments and industry will be
tempted to use the technology to monitor individual behaviour. 'If
someone used your fingerprints to match your health-insurance records
with a credit-card record showing you regularly bought lots of cigarettes
and fatty foods,' says one policy analyst, 'you would see your insurance
payments go through the roof.' In Toronto, critics of the welfare
fingerprint plan complained that it would stigmatise recipients by forcing
them to submit to a procedure widely identified with criminals.

H

Nonetheless, support for biometrics is growing in Toronto as it is in many
other communities. In an increasingly crowded and complicated world,
biometrics may well be a technology whose time has come.

Green Wave Washes Over Mainstream Shopping

V

Research in Britain has shown that green
consumers' continue to flourish as a
significant group amongst shoppers. This
suggests that politicians who claim
environmentalism is yesterday's issue
may be seriously misjudging the public
mood.
A report from Mintel, the market
research organisation, says that despite
recession and financial pressures, more
people than ever want to buy
environmentally friendly products and a
'green wave' has swept through
consumerism, taking in people
previously untouched by environmental
concerns. The recently published report
also predicts that the process will repeat
itself with 'ethical' concerns, involving
issues such as fair trade with the Third
World and the social record of
businesses. Companies will have to be
more honest and open in response to
this mood.
Mintel's survey, based on nearly 1,000
consumers, found that the proportion
who look for green products and are
prepared to pay more for them has
climbed from 53 per cent in 1990 to
around 60 per cent in 1994. On average,
they will pay 13 per cent more for such
products, although this percentage is
higher among women, managerial and

professional groups and those aged 35
to 44.
Between 1990 and 1994 the
proportion of consumers claiming to be
unaware of or unconcerned about green
issues fell from 18 to 10 per cent but the
number of green spenders among older
people and manual workers has risen
substantially. Regions such as Scotland
have also caught up with the south of
England in their environmental concerns.
According to Mintel, the image of green
consumerism as associated in the past
with the more eccentric members of
society has virtually disappeared. The
consumer research manager for Mintel,
Angela Hughes, said it had become
firmly established as a mainstream
market. She explained that as far as the
average person is concerned
environmentalism has not gone off the
boil'. In fact, it has spread across a much
wider range of consumer groups, ages
and occupations.
Mintel's 1994 survey found that 13 per
cent of consumers are 'very dark green',
nearly always buying environmentally
friendly products, 28 per cent are 'dark
green', trying 'as far as possible' to buy
such products, and 21 per cent are 'pale
green' - tending to buy green products if
they see them. Another 26 per cent are

'armchair greens'; they said they care
about environmental issues but their
concern does not affect their spending
habits. Only 10 per cent say they do not
care about green issues.
Four in ten people are 'ethical
spenders', buying goods which do not,
for example, involve dealings with
oppressive regimes. This figure is the
same as in 1990, although the number of
'armchair ethicals' has risen from 28 to
35 per cent and only 22 per cent say they
are unconcerned now, against 30 per
cent in 1990. Hughes claims that in the
twenty-first century, consumers will be
encouraged to think more about the
entire history of the products and

services they buy, including the policies
of the companies that provide them and
that this will require a greater degree of
honesty with consumers,
Among green consumers, animal
testing is the top issue - 48 per cent said
they would be deterred from buying a
product it if had been tested on animals followed by concerns regarding
irresponsible selling, the ozone layer,
river and sea pollution, forest destruction,
recycling and factory farming. However,
concern for specific issues is lower than
in 1990, suggesting that many
consumers feel that Government and
business have taken on the
environmental agenda.

READING PASSAGE 2

Complete the summary using words from the box below.
Write your answers in boxes 10-13 on your answer sheet.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26 which are based on Reading Passage 2
below.

NB There are more answers than spaces, so you will not use them all.

A

There is a great concern in Europe and North America about declining
standards of literacy in schools. In Britain, the fact that 30 per cent of 16
year olds have a reading age of 14 or less has helped to prompt massive
educational changes. The development of literacy has far-reaching effects
on general intellectual development and thus anything which impedes the
development of literacy is a serious matter for us all. So the hunt is on for
the cause of the decline in literacy. The search so far has focused on socioeconomic factors, or the effectiveness of 'traditional' versus 'modern'
teaching techniques.

B

The fruitless search for the cause of the increase in illiteracy is a tragic
example of the saying 'They can't see the wood for the trees'. When
teachers use picture books, they are simply continuing a long-established
tradition that is accepted without question. And for the past two decades,
illustrations in reading primers have become increasingly detailed and
obtrusive, while language has become impoverished — sometimes to the
point of extinction.

C

Amazingly, there is virtually no empirical evidence to support the use of
illustrations in teaching reading. On the contrary, a great deal of empirical
evidence shows that pictures interfere in a damaging way with all aspects of
learning to read. Despite this, from North America to the Antipodes, the
first books that many school children receive are totally without text.

D

A teacher's main concern is to help young beginner readers to develop not
only the ability to recognise words, but the skills necessary to understand
what these words mean. Even if a child is able to read aloud fluently, he or
she may not be able to understand much of it: this is called 'barking at text'.
The teacher's task of improving comprehension is made harder by
influences outside the classroom. But the adverse effects of such things as
television, video games, or limited language experiences at home, can be
offset by experiencing 'rich' language at school.

E

Instead, it is not unusual for a book of 30 or more pages to have only one
sentence full of repetitive phrases. The artwork is often marvellous, but the
pictures make the language redundant, and the children have no need to
imagine anything when they read such books. Looking at a picture actively
prevents children younger than nine from creating a mental image, and can
make it difficult for older children. In order to learn how to comprehend,
they need to practise making their own meaning in response to text. They
need to have their innate powers of imagination trained.

The Mintel report suggests that in future companies will be forced to
practise greater ... (10) ... in their dealings because of the increased

As they grow older, many children turn aside from books without pictures,
and it is a situation made more serious as our culture becomes more visual.
It is hard to wean children off picture books when pictures have played a
major part throughout their formative reading experiences, and when there
is competition for their attention from so many other sources of
entertainment. The least intelligent are most vulnerable, but tests show that
even intelligent children are being affected. The response of educators has
been to extend the use of pictures in books and to simplify the language,
even at senior levels. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge recently
held joint conferences to discuss the noticeably rapid decline in literacy
among their undergraduates.
Pictures are also used to help motivate children to read because they are
beautiful and eye-catching. But motivation to read should be provided by
listening to stories well read, where children imagine in response to the
story. Then, as they start to read, they have this experience to help them
understand the language. If we present pictures to save children the
trouble of developing these creative skills, then I think we are making a
great mistake.

H

Academic journals ranging from educational research, psychology, language
learning, psycholinguistics, and so on cite experiments which demonstrate
how detrimental pictures are for beginner readers. Here is a brief selection:

I

The research results of the Canadian educationalist Dale Willows were
clear and consistent: pictures affected speed and accuracy and the closer
the pictures were to the words, the slower and more inaccurate the child's
reading became. She claims that when children come to a word they
already know, then the pictures are unnecessary and distracting. If they do
not know a word and look to the picture for a clue to its meaning, they may
well be misled by aspects of the pictures which are not closely related to
the meaning of the word they are trying to understand.

J

Jay Samuels, an American psychologist, found that poor readers given no
pictures learnt significantly more words than those learning to read with
books with pictures. He examined the work of other researchers who had
reported problems with the use of pictures and who found that a word
without a picture was superior to a word plus a picture.When children
were given words and pictures, those who seemed to ignore the pictures
and pointed at the words learnt more words than the children who pointed
at the pictures, but they still learnt fewer words than the children who had
no illustrated stimuli at all.

WEST THAMES COLLEGE
BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES
West Thames College (initially known as
Hounslow Borough College) came into
existence in 1976 following the merger of
Isleworth Polytechnic with part of
Chiswick Polytechnic. Both parent
colleges, in various guises, enjoyed a long
tradition of service to the community
dating back to the 1890s.
The college is located at London Road,
Isleworth, on a site occupied by the
Victorian house of the Pears family. Spring
Grove House. An earlier house of the
same name on this site had been the
home of Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist
who named Botany Bay with Captain
Cook in 1770. Later he founded Kew
Gardens.
Situated at the heart of West London,
West Thames College is ideally placed to
serve the training and education needs of
local industry and local people. But its
influence reaches much further than the
immediate locality.
Under its former name, Hounslow
Borough College, it had already
established a regional, national and
international reputation for excellence. In
fact, about eight per cent of its students
come from continental Europe and further
afield, whilst a further 52 per cent are from
outside the immediate area. Since 1 April
1993, when it became independent of the
local authority and adopted its new title,
West Thames College has continued to
build on that first class reputation.
These days there is no such thing as a

typical student. More than half of West
Thames College's 6000 students are over
19 years old. Some of these will be
attending college part-time under their
employers' training schemes. Others will
want to learn new skills purely out of
interest, or out of a desire to improve their
promotion chances, or they may want a
change in career.
The college is also very popular with
16-18 year olds, who see it as a practical
alternative to a further two years at
school. They want to study in the more
adult atmosphere the college provides.
They can choose from a far wider range of
subjects than it would be practical for a
sixth form to offer. If they want to go
straight into employment they can still
study at college to gain qualifications
relevant to the job, either on a day-release
basis or through Network or the Modern
Apprenticeship Scheme.

by the royal grant in
recognition of his work, he
was able to devote himself
entirely to astronomy. His final
achievements spread from the
sun and moon to remote
galaxies (of which he
discovered hundreds), and
papers flooded from his pen
until his death in 1822.
Among these there was one
sent to the Royal Society in
1781, entitled An Account of a
Comet. In his own words:

Read the following passage and answer Questions 27-40.

The Discovery of Uranus

Someone once put forward an
attractive though unlikely
theory. Throughout the Earth's
annual revolution around the
sun there is one point of space
always hidden from our eyes.
This point is the opposite part
of the Earth's orbit, which is
always hidden by the sun.
Could there be another planet
there, essentially similar to our
own, but always invisible?
If a space probe today sent
back evidence that such a
world existed it would cause
not much more sensation than
Sir William Herschel's

discovery of a new planet,
Uranus, in 1781.
Herschel was an
extraordinary man — no other
astronomer has ever covered
so vast a field of work — and
his career deserves study. He
was born in Hanover in
Germany in 1738, left the
German army in 1757, and
arrived in England the same
year with no money but quite
exceptional music ability. He
played the violin and oboe and
at one time was organist in the
Octagon Chapel in the city of
Bath. Herschel's was an active

mind, and deep inside he was
conscious that music was not
his destiny; he therefore read
widely in science and the arts,
but not until 1772 did he come
across a book on astronomy.
He was then 34, middle-aged
by the standards of the time,
but without hesitation he
embarked on his new career,
financing it by his professional
work as a musician. He spent
years mastering the art of
telescope construction, and
even by present-day standards
his instruments are
comparable with the best.

On Tuesday the 13th of
March, between ten and
eleven in the evening,
while I was examining the
small stars in the
neighbourhood of H
Geminorum, I perceived
one that appeared visibly
larger than the rest; being
struck with its uncommon
magnitude, I compared it to
H Geminorum and the
small star in the quartile
between Auriga and

Gemini, and finding it to be
much larger than either of
them, suspected it to be a
comet.
Herschel's care was the
hallmark of a great observer;
he was not prepared to jump
to any conclusions. Also, to be
fair, the discovery of a new
planet was the last thought in
anybody's mind. But further
observation by other
astronomers besides Herschel
revealed two curious facts. For
a comet, it showed a
remarkably sharp disc;
furthermore, it was moving so
slowly that it was thought to
be a great distance from the
sun, and comets are only
normally visible in the
immediate vicinity of the sun.
As its orbit came to be worked
out the truth dawned that it
was a new planet far beyond
Saturn's realm, and that the
'reviewer of the heavens' had
stumbled across an
unprecedented prize. Herschel
wanted to call it georgium
sidus (Star of George) in
honour of his royal patron
King George III of Great
Britain. The planet was later
for a time called Herschel in
honour of its discoverer. The
name Uranus, which was first
proposed by the German
astronomer Johann Elert Bode,
was in use by the late 19th
century.

Uranus is a giant in
construction, but not so much
in size; its diameter compares
unfavourably with that of
Jupiter and Saturn, though on
the terrestrial scale it is still
colossal. Uranus' atmosphere
consists largely of hydrogen
and helium, with a trace of
methane. Through a telescope
the planet appears as a small
bluish-green disc with a faint
green periphery. In 1977,
while recording the
occultation1 of a star behind
the planet, the American
astronomer James L. Elliot
discovered the presence of five
rings encircling the equator of
Uranus. Four more rings were
discovered in January 1986
during the exploratory flight of
Voyager 22, In addition to its
rings, Uranus has 15 satellites
('moons'), the last 10
discovered by Voyager 2 on
the same flight; all revolve
about its equator and move
with the planet in an
east—west direction. The two
largest moons, Titania and
Oberon, were discovered by
Herschel in 1787. The next
two, Umbriel and Ariel, were
found in 1851 by the British
astronomer William Lassell.
Miranda, thought before 1986
to be the innermost moon, was
discovered in 1948 by the
American astronomer Gerard
Peter Kuiper.

A
The newspaper production process has come a
long way from the old days when the paper was
written, edited, typeset and ultimately printed
in one building with the journalists working on
the upper floors and the printing presses going
on the ground floor. These days the editor, subeditors and journalists who put the paper
together are likely to find themselves in a totally
different building or maybe even in a different
city. This is the situation which now prevails in
Sydney. The daily paper is compiled at the
editorial headquarters, known as the pre-press
centre, in the heart of the city but printed far
away in the suburbs at the printing centre. Here
human beings are in the minority as much of
the work is done by automated machines
controlled by computers.

transmission is an update on the sophisticated
page facsimile system already in use on many
other newspapers. An image-setter at the
printing centre delivers the pages as film. Each
page takes less than a minute to produce,
although for colour pages four versions are
used, one each for black, cyan, magenta and
yellow. The pages are then processed into
photographic negatives and the film is used to
produce aluminium printing plates ready for the
presses.

C
A procession of automated vehicles is busy at
the new printing centre where the Sydney
Morning Herald is printed each day. With lights
flashing and warning horns honking, the robots
(to give them their correct name, the LGVs or
B
laser-guided vehicles) look for all the world like

The robots' principle job, however, is to shift the
newsprint (the printing paper) that arrives at
the plant in huge reels and emerges at the other
end some time later as newspapers. Once the
size of the day's paper and the publishing order
are determined at head office, the information is
punched into the computer and the LGVs are
programmed to go about their work. The LGVs
collect the appropriate size paper reels and take
them where they have to go. When the press
needs another reel its computer alerts the LGV
system. The Sydney LGVs move busily around
the press room fulfilling their two key functions
- to collect reels of newsprint either from the
reel stripping stations or from the racked
supplies in the newsprint storage area. At the
stripping station the tough wrapping that helps
to protect a reel of paper from rough handling
is removed. Any damaged paper is peeled off
and the reel is then weighed.

the press. If not needed immediately, an LGV
takes it to the storage area. When the press
computer calls for a reel, an LGV takes it to the
reel-loading area of the presses. It lifts the reel
onto the loading position and places it in the
correct spot with complete accuracy. As each
reel is used up, the press drops the heavy
waste
bin,
and
when
the
bin is full, another LGV collects it and deposits
the cores into a shredder for recycling.

The LGVs move at walking speed. Should
anyone step in front of one or get too close,
sensors stop the vehicle until the path is clear,
The company has chosen a laser-guide function
system for the vehicles because, as the project
development manager says, 'The beauty of it is
that if you want to change the routes, you can
work out a new route on your computer and lay
it down for them to follow.' When an LGVs
batteries run low, it will take itself off line and go
to the nearest battery maintenance point for
replacement batteries. And all this is achieved
with absolute minimum human input and a
much reduced risk of injury to people working in
the printing centres.

INTERVIEWER A dream came true in 1995, when over 96 days of the spring and summer,
an expedition of four men undertook what they believe to have been the
first and only complete end-to-end crossing of Morocco's Attora
mountains. I talked to Charles Owen, the leader of the expedition group,
about the trip.
Charles, how much planning went on beforehand?
CHARLES
Well, as you know, I run these walking trips across the mountains for
tourists and over the years, I've collected maps and other data to prepare
what I call a 'route book' for this trip and this book basically shows the
route across the mountains that we took.
INTERVIEWER You actually broke records while you were out there, didn't you?
CHARLES
Mmm. Yes, it was 900 miles in total and we managed to climb 32 peaks
that were over 3000 metres high, including Toubkal, which is of course the
highest in North Africa. We weren't actually out to make a name for
ourselves - it just happened really.
INTERVIEWER What was the. weather like?
CHARLES
It got us right from day one and we were pretty taken aback really to find
that it rained on quite a number of days, and so we were forced to start
re-planning our route almost from the outset. One of the obvious
problems is the heavy snow which blocks the mountain passes, so you have
to make considerable detours. When we were on the way to Imilchil, for
example, the snow forced us into a northern bypass which was new to us,
but anyway, either way we would have been rewarded because we fell upon
amazing, high meadows, huge gorges and wonderful snow-capped
mountains. The scenery was as fine as any we saw on the trip and that was
how it was every time - having to take another pass was never a
disappointment.
INTERVIEWER It was in many ways a social trip, wasn't it?

everyone and the Hotel Ali in Marrakech was a good social base - I'd really
recommend it, although I can't remember who runs it. Anyway, groups of • Q18
friends actually joined us for three-week stints and others just linked up
with us. Some, whom we hadn't met before the trip at all, tagged on for
short bursts - people from the area - who just came along for the ride. But
outside the major visitor areas like Toubkal we only met one other group
of travellers like ourselves in the whole 96 days.
INTERVIEWER Were there any bad moments?
CHARLES
We took two, I must say, long-suffering donkeys with us to help transport
water and tents and things. I suppose if we were to do it all again we'd
probably hire donkeys along the way. Taza and Tamri, as we called them

after the last places in the trip, well, they made quite a unique journey
between them, and . . . but it was continuously demanding for them. On
both the really high summits, they took diversions that were quite out of

journey and continues to lead groups to the Attora mountains, so if you
want further information . . .

Friday, not Saturday.
TIM But we didn't have to be here till today.
JANE Yes, I know, but I wanted to get my things moved into my room, and just take a
look around. So, did you decide to do English in the end?
TIM No, I changed my mind and opted for history instead. And you're doing biology, if
I remember correctly.
JANE Yes, although to start with I couldn't decide between that and geography.
TIM How much reading have you got? I was given an amazingly long list of books to
read. See!
JANE Wow, it does look pretty long.

JANE It's going to be different from school, isn't it!
TIM Yeah, particularly the lectures. Have you got any special strategy for listening to
lectures?
JANE Well I'm going to use a cassette recorder and record them all.
TIM What! Are you allowed to?
JANE Sure. Lots of people do it nowadays. It means you can listen to the lectures all over
again later, and make really good notes.
TIM I couldn't do that. I like to take notes as I'm listening. I usually find I get all the
important points. Reading is different of course. My approach is to skim the book
first to see what's important and what isn't. It saves hours of time.
JANE But what if you miss something?
TIM You don't mean you're going to read every word, do you?
JANE Well, that's what I usually do.
TIM Well, that's up to you, but I think you're crazy!
JANE What's your first lecture on, anyway?
TIM Oh, it's a lecture on the French Revolution.
JANE The French Revolution! How boring!
TIM It's not boring at all! It was an amazing period of history. It changed everything in
Europe. So what's your first lecture about?
JANE It's about animal behaviour. It sounds really interesting.
TIM Look, I was on my way to the library. I'm going to get some of these books out
and start reading for the first essay I've got to write.
JANE And what have you got to write about?
TIM Well, you'll never believe it, I think our professor must have a sense of humour.
He's given us the title "Why study history?"
JANE That's a good one. When you find the answer, let me know!
TIM I'm going to enjoy writing it. Have you been given any writing assignments yet?
JANE Yes, I've got to write about animal language.
TIM Hmm! That sounds a challenge. I suppose you'll be off to the zoo to do field research.

Welcome to further education Information Week. This is the Physical Education Faculty's
session and I'm the Head of the Faculty. During the course of this morning we hope to
give you a clear idea of what we offer in our training programs and we will look at the
types of courses and the entry requirements, if any, for those courses. Some of these
courses are open to school leavers, but for some you need previous qualifications, or
relevant successful employment.

So firstly, the Physical Fitness Instructor's course is offered as a six-month certificate
course which includes an important component of personal fitness but there are no specific
entry requirements.
For Sports Administrators we provide a four-month certificate course but you should be
aware that this is designed for those who are in employment. This employment must be
current and related to sports administration.
For the Sports Psychologist course we offer a one-year diploma course, but this diploma
course is available only to those who already hold a degree in psychology, so you need to
make sure you have that before you apply to do this course.
Now . . . for Physical Education Teachers we offer a four-year degree in education.
This degree course is designed for preparing students to teach in primary and secondary
Schools and needs no prior qualifications as it is entered directly by school leavers.
And lastly for the Recreation Officer's course we offer a six-month certificate. Entry to
this course normally includes applicants of a wide range of ages and experiences, but we
do not insist on any prerequisites for this course.
Remember that this is a vocational training institute. We train you so that you can take
up a particular kind of job. So it is important that you know the main roles of the jobs what the work is like and what kind of qualities you need to succeed at them.
A Physical Fitness Instructor works in health and fitness centres preparing individual
programs for ordinary members of the public. Physical Fitness Instructors prepare
routines of exercises to suit the individual client's age and level of fitness.
Sports Administrators run clubs and sporting associations. Their duties include such
things as booking playing fields with local councils and organising the schedule of games
or events for the club, so they need good organisational skills.
Sports Psychologists spend time with professional athletes helping them approach
competition with a positive mental attitude to enable them to achieve their personal best.
They do this by improving motivation and concentration or assisting with stress
management.
Physical Education or PE Teachers instruct young students in how to exercise, play
sport, and do other recreational activities correctly and safely. PE teachers help the
development of co-ordination, balance, posture, and flexibility with things like simple
catching and throwing skills. They are not expected to be experts in all sports, but must be
able to show students the basic techniques involved in a wide range of activities.
Recreation Officers often find themselves working for local government authorities and
local groups. Their aim is to raise people's awareness of healthy lifestyles and improved
general fitness through arranging recreational activities for groups of all ages from the very
young to the elderly.
There are many other job opportunities which our graduates can look forward to. If
you are interested in any of these ...

Fine. Well, let's get some details. What kind of apartment is it?
It's a two-bedroom apartment.
What floor is it on?
Why do you need to know that?
Because it affects the cost of the insurance. An apartment on the ground floor
isn't as protected as others and there's more chance of a break-in.
Really? I didn't know that. It's on the third, no,. .. second
floor.

How much do you think they're worth?
The watches are worth $1,000 . . .
For both of them?
No, each one and, all together, the CDs and books cost me about S400.

SECTION 2

You'll also notice, when you receive your orientation pack shortly, that there are two keys.
One is the key to your room and only you have that key - and the other is a key to the front
door which you've just come through here from the street. This door is closed and locked at
8 pm every night and opened again at 7 am. You'll need your key if you're coming back to
the college between those times. We ask all students to always enter and leave the college
through the front door. You will notice at the end of each corridor that there is another
door but these are fire doors and are kept locked from the outside. They should only be
opened from the inside in case of emergency.
In your fees you've paid a laundry fee which covers the cleaning of bed linen and towels.
All bed linen and towels are clearly embossed with the name Smith House so it's easily
identifiable. If you want your other laundry to be done by the college this can be arranged
for a small extra fee.
There are only a few rules here at Smith House and we have these rules so that we can all
live comfortably together. The most important rule is that there must be no noise after 9 pm.
There is also no smoking in the rooms or anywhere inside the college but smoking is
permitted on the balconies.
All meals are served in the dining room. Meal times are listed in your orientation pack.
Please read these carefully as meal times cannot be changed and if you arrive late I'm sorry
to say you'll just go hungry.
If you're unsure about things, each floor has an elected 'floor senior' who is usually a
student in their third or fourth year of study who's been at Smith House for a while. The
floor seniors will introduce themselves later today and answer any questions you have. But
for now I'm going to hand you over to Marney who is going to give you the orientation
packs and keys. Thanks Marney.

SECTION 3

COLLEGE PRESIDENT

Well, good morning, everyone, it's good to see you all here. Welcome to Smith House.
Smith House as you may or may not know is one of the oldest residential colleges of the
university. As you can see, the building you're in now which contains this main lounge, the
dining room, the recreation room, the kitchen and the offices was part of the original old
house, built in the 1840s to be used by the family of George Smith. That's of course how
the house and college got their names. The original house was converted into, a residential
college for the university in 1940 and since then has continued to be added on to and
modernised.
You'll notice when you receive your room allocation in a few minutes that your room
number either begins with the letter N, S, or W like this one here. The first letter refers to
the three wings of the college which come away from this main building. Of course the
letters represent the three directions - in this case - north, south and west. Each wing has
two floors, and so the next number you see is either one, or in this case two, and this
indicates which floor your room is on. The number after that is your individual room
number. So it's quite simple to find any room by going to the right wing, then floor, and
then room number.

That essay we have to write . . . the one on how children learn through the
media . . . how are you planning to write it?
Well, I've given it some thought and I think that the best way to approach it is
to divide the essay into two parts. First of all, we'd have to look at some
examples of each type of media . . .
Yes, what they are . .. then we could describe how we can use each medium so
that children can learn something from each one.
Exactly. Maybe we could draw up a table and look at examples of each medium
in turn. Let's see, the different forms of media would b e . . . the print media . . .
Here you'd have things like books and newspapers, that sort of thing . . .
Urn, and included in these are the pictorial forms of print media, like maps . . .
Yes, maps are really just formal pictures, aren't they? And then there are what we
call the audio forms of media . . . where children can listen. CDs and radios are
probably the best examples, because a lot of children have access to these
especially radious.
And this would lead into the audio-visual media, which can be seen as well as
heard . . . film, television . . . and we mustn't forget videos.

Yes, but there's a final category as well . . . computers, that make up the socalled electronic media. In the United Kingdom and Australia, they say that one
in three families has a computer now.
Yes, I believe it. Well that's a good list to start with . .. we're really getting
somewhere with this essay now . . . so let's move on to when each type of
medium could be used. I guess we could start by trying to identify the best
situation for each type of media.
What do you mean?
I'm talking about whether each medium should be used with different sized
groups. For example, we could look at pictures, and ask whether they're more
useful for an individual child, a few children together or a full class - in this case,
I'd say pictures are best with individual children, because they give them an
opportunity to let their imaginations run wild.

LYNNE

Q25

Example

Yes, I see . . .

ROBIN

Let's take tapes next. Although tapes look ideal for individual children, I feel
Q26
they're best suited to small group work. This way, children don't feel isolated,
because they can get help from their friends. Computers are the same . . . I think Q27
they're better with small numbers of children and they're hardly ever useful with
a whole class. Videos, however, are ideal for use with everyone present in the
Q28
class, especially when children have individual activity sheets to help them focus
their minds on what's in the video.
LYNNE
And what about books, what would you recommend for them? Books are ideal
Q29
for children to use by themselves. I know they're used with groups in schools, but
I wouldn't recommend it. Other pictorial media like maps, though, are different
Q30
. . . I'd always plan group work around those . .. give the children a chance to
interact and to share ideas.
ROBIN
I agree . . . teachers often just leave maps on the wall for children to look at
when they have some free time, but kids really enjoy using them for problem
solving.
LYNNE
Yes, different people have different ideas I suppose .. .
ROBIN
Yes, and different teachers recommend different tools for different age groups . . .

SECTION 4
LECTURER

I hope that this first session, which I've called An Introduction to British Agriculture, will
provide a helpful background to the farm visits you'll be doing next week.
I think I should start by emphasising that agriculture still accounts for a very important
part of this country's economy. We are used to hearing the UK's society and economy
described as being 'industrial' or even 'post-industrial', but we mustn't let this blind us to
the fact that agriculture and its supporting industries still account for around 20% of our
Gross National Product.
This figure is especially impressive, I think, when you bear in mind how very small a
percentage of the UK workforce is employed in agriculture. This is not a recent

development - you would have to go back to 1750 or so to find a majority of the
workforce in this country working in agriculture: By the middle of the next century, in
1850 that is, it had fallen sharply to 10%, and then to 3% by the middle of the twentieth
century.
And now just 2% of the workforce contribute 20% of GNP. How is this efficiency
achieved? Well, my own view is that it owes a great deal to a history, over the last 50 or 60
years, of intelligent support by the state, mainly taking the form of helping farmers to plan
ahead. Then the two other factors I should mention, both very important, are the high
level of training amongst the agricultural workforce. And secondly, the recognition by
farmers of the value of investing in technology.
Now, although the UK is a fairly small country, the geology and climate vary a good
deal from region to region. For our purposes today we can divide the country broadly into
three - I've marked them on the map here (indicates map).
The region you'll get to know best, of course, is the north, where we are at present. The
land here is generally hilly, and the soils thin. The climate up here, and you've already had
evidence of this, is generally cool and wet. As you will see next week, the typical farm here
in the North is a small, family-run concern, producing mainly wool and timber for the
market.
If we contrast that with the Eastern region, over here (indicating on map), the east is
flatter and more low-lying, with fertile soils and a mixed climate. Average farm-size is much
bigger in the east, and farms are likely to be managed strictly on commercial lines. As for
crops, well, the east is the UK's great cereal-producing region. However, increasingly
significant areas are now also given over to high quality vegetables for supply direct to the
supermarkets.
The third broad region is the west, where it's a different story again. The climate is
warmer than in the north and much wetter than in the east. The resulting rich soils in the
west provide excellent pasture, and the farms there are quite large, typically around 800
hectares. The main products are milk, cheese and meat.
So, clearly, there are marked differences between regions. But this does not prevent quite
a strong sense of solidarity amongst the farming community as a whole, right across the
country. This solidarity comes in part from the need to present a united front in dealing
with other powerful interest-groups, such as government or the media. It also owes
something to the close co-operation between all the agricultural training colleges, through
which the great majority of farmers pass at the beginning of their careers. And a third
factor making for solidarity is the national structure of the Farmers' Union, of which
virtually all farmers are members.
Finally in this short talk, I would like to say a little about the challenges facing farmers
in the next. . .

B No, I don't mind. It's £40,000 a year.
A Thank you. R i g h t . . . about your current watching habits . . . what would you say is
your main reason for watching TV?
B Well, at work I tend to read for information and what have you, so I'd say that with TV
it probably just helps me relax and unwind.

B Not a lot really . . . I should say just over an hour.

So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV?

And what sort of programmes do you go for?
Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old
comedy shows.
Fine. And turning to the new c h a n n e l . . . which type of programmes would you like to
see more of?
Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and
documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information ... you know,
providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for
younger viewers .. . you know, good quality stuff.

Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up
the channel, what advice would you give them?
I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast,
you know, the sound system. People are very fussy these days about that and in general
I think they ought to do lots more of these kinds of interview, you know, talking with
their potential customers.
Oh, I'm glad you think it's valuable!
Certainly . . . yeah.
Good. OK, this will be a commercial channel of course, but how often do you think it
is tolerable to have adverts?
Well out of that list I'd say every quarter of an hour. 1 don't think we can complain
about that, as long as they don't last for ten minutes each time!
Quite. And . . . would you be willing to attend any of our special promotions for the
new channel?
Yes, I'd be very happy to, as long as they're held here in my area.
OK, I'll make a note of that. And finally, may we put you on our mailing list?

STUDENT

OK, well, good morning everybody! My name's Elizabeth Reed and I'm your
Assistant Welfare Officer. What I'd like to do now is tell you a little more
about some of the er . . . the social facilities available on the campus, and also
to tell you something about what the town has to offer.
As you probably know already, the Student Union Building is the main
centre of social life here, as indeed it is in most British Universities. The
Union runs a weekly programme of events for all tastes . . . oh everything
from discos to talks by guest speakers. Many of these events are fund raising
activities for charities, which the Union takes very seriously. They manage the
Students' Union papershop, selling magazines and newspapers, as well as
stationery, sweets and so on. Um . . . Then . . . er, let me s e e . . . there's the
Ticket Shop, where you can get some very good deals on, well for example,
coaches to London or inexpensive charter flights, as cheap as you'll get
anywhere people say, or tickets for big pop groups playing here or at other
venues all over the country, or plays in London - oh and we mustn't forget
the Union Cafeteria and the Big New D i n e r . . . Er . . . yes? Did you have a
question?
Yes, does the Union also provide help with any problems, I mean advice on
financial problems, for example? Or does the University provide that?

Qll
Q12
Q13

QJ4

ELIZABETH: Yes, the Union run their own advice service, offering help with
financial
matters such as grants. I am sure you realise anything medical should be
discussed with the University Medical Service, which also has an excellent
counselling centre. I think that was made clear yesterday. However the Union
has its own officer who can give advice on legal problems.
Now, onto Radford. For a town of its size, Radford has some unusually
good leisure and community facilities and has quite a good shopping centre,
with an interesting range of shops. As you go into Radford, there's a new . . .
well, quite new .. . Olympic-size swimming pool. That's on the outskirts at a
place called Renton. Above the pool there's a hi-tech fitness centre. Are there
any ice skaters here? No? Oh, pity! The facilities for ice-skating are excellent.
Well, the new Metro Tower, right in the centre of town has got an ice rink
and a sports hall for squash, badminton, volleyball and several other indoor
sports. And in the same building there's a new cinema with six screens. Er . . .
then, let me see, in the main square, just two minutes' walk from the Metro
Tower, there's the Theatre Royal, which often gets London productions on
t o u r . . . and in the streets nearby you can find a good range of inexpensive
restaurants including Indian, Chinese, Thai and . . .

Well, sir, just some advice really. It's about computers . .. would you advise
us to buy one?
What can 1 say, Andy? I know it's a massive expense, but I really feel that it
will be of great benefit... you can always look in the Student Union adverts
for second hand ones. Yes?
I've been looking at some of last year's dissertations.
Is that a good idea, sir? I heard . . .
Well, I don't think you should read them in detail too early or you might end
up taking more of their ideas than you realise. But yes . . . it really is the best
guide you can have to the expectations of the . . . of what's expected when
you write a dissertation.
Sorry, Jane, I interrupted you.
That's OK. It's just that they did a lot of research using questionnaires . . . is
that a good idea?
I think questionnaires are very good at telling you how people
questionnaires, but to be frank they tell you very little else. Avoid them!
About interviews . . . is it OK if we interview you?
The tutors? I don't see why not; they don't have any special contribution to
make, but you can if you want. There's a whole section on this issue in the
Research Guide. I'm afraid it's slightly out of date, and you're probably

rainfall. Long hours of hot sunshine and searing winds give Australia an extremely high
rate of evaporation, far more than in most other countries. It is estimated that
approximately 87% of Australia's rainfall is lost through evaporation, compared with just
over 60% in Europe and Africa and 48% in North America. You generally think of Africa
as being a very hot and dry place, but it is not in comparison with Australia. In many parts
of Australia standing water, that is dams, puddles and so forth, dry up rapidly and some
rainfall barely penetrates the soil. The reason for this is that the moisture is absorbed by
thirsty plants.
Some parts of Australia are dry because rainwater seeps quickly through sandy soils
and into the rock below. In parts of Australia this water which seeps through the sandy
soil collects underground to form underground lakes. Water from these subterranean lakes
can be pumped to the surface and tapped and so used for various purposes above the
ground. In fact, extensive underground water resources are available over more than half
of Australia's land area, but most of the water is too salty to be used for human
consumption or for the irrigation of crops. However, most inland farmers do rely on this
water for watering their animals and, where possible, to a lesser extent for irrigation.
Underground water can flow very large distances and can be kept in underground
reservoirs for a very long time. Water from these underground reservoirs bubbles to the
surface as springs in some parts of the country, and these rare sources of permanent water
were vital to early explorers of inland Australia, and to other pioneers last century, who
used the springs for survival. But in many places levels have fallen drastically through
continuous use over the years. This has necessitated the pumping of the water to the
surface. Remarkably, underground water sources in Australia supply about 18% of
total water consumption. So you can see it is quite an important source of water in this dry
land.
So most of the consumption of water in Australia comes from water which is kept
above ground. More than 300 dams regulate river flows around the country. The dams
store water for a variety of functions, the rural irrigation of crops, without which many
productive areas of the country would not be able to be farmed; the regulation of flooding,
a serious problem which will be dealt with later in the course; and last but not least, the
harnessing of the force of gravity for the generation of electricity.
That is all we have time for this morning, but you will be able to do further study on this
important area in the library. I have a handout here with references on the subject, so if
you are interested, please come up to the desk and take a copy.
Next week's lecture is a case study of an outback farm and . . .

Q10

You've chosen to visit the rainforest in March, which is just at the end of the wet season,
so you'll soon notice how well the waterfalls are running and also how damp the ground is.
Things can tend to get a bit slippery, too, so if you didn't bring any walking boots I'd
advise you to hire some from the office. You'll also be much better off in long trousers
rather than shorts because they will give your legs more protection, and socks are a good
idea too.
There's no need to be nervous of the rainforest provided that you treat it with respect
and common sense. Most of the animals and wildlife are gentle and harmless. There are
some venomous snakes to beware of, but really they're much more frightened of you than
you are of them. The other thing is that certain plants can cause irritation if you touch
them with bare skin.
Well, that's about all for the time being. The guys are here to take you and your luggage
to the cabins . . .

COUNSELLOR Hello, John, What can I do for you?
JOHN
Well, I heard about these counselling sessions from a friend doing a science
course and I was really interested. I think they should be compulsory really.
COUNSELLOR Well to be quite honest, John, I think they would be useful for everybody
but well, everybody has their own way of going about things. I prefer
people just to drop in when they can.

SECTION 2
RECREATION OFFICER

Great. Well, hi, everyone! My name's Jody and I'm one of the four recreation officers here
at Rainforest Lodge. My job is to make sure that you all have a great stay here with us and
go away feeling relaxed and refreshed. As you can see, we're literally in the middle of
nowhere at the Lodge. There are no newspapers or TVs and there's only one phone and
that's in the office. The Lodge is a complete 'getaway from it all' experience: a place to
unwind and appreciate the world without a lot of interruptions and distractions.
From your cabin balcony you'll find that you can't see anyone else and the only noise
you should hear is the birds. When the luggage comes, one of the guys will take it across to
your cabin for you and make sure you know the way back here to the main centre for
dinner in the restaurant. Dinner will be served in about an hour or so.
All the times of each day's activities are printed on the blue sheet you should have got in
the information guides that were handed out on the coach. Each Explorer trip has a
different focus, so it doesn't matter how many you do or on what day, because there's
always something new to discover in the rainforest.
Tomorrow 1 think we've still got places on the Orchid and Fungi Tour. This is on foot

and takes you to different parts of the rainforest. Or, if you'd prefer, there's the FourWheel-Drive tour to the waterfalls, or the fishing trip where I promise you we'll catch some
lunch, and last but not least, the famous Crocodile Cruise that leaves at 11 am each day.
(Just in time for the crocodile's lunch!) Plenty to choose from here at Rainforest Lodge or
just sit on your balcony, relax and unwind and enjoy the views. In the evenings there is the
Spotlight Tour, one of my favourites. The Spotlight Tour leaves at sundown and lets you
catch a glimpse of some more of the rainforest's wildlife as it comes out at dusk to feed.
That's a great trip and if you can, I'd really try to make sure you do it during your stay.

JOHN

Q11

Q12

Q21

Yes.

COUNSELLOR I find that talking to students about the requirements of a course helps to
clarify what needs to be done. I mean the biggest difference between college
and school is that new college students really have to do a lot of work on
their own, and it's sometimes useful to get advice on how to take control of
your time and work effectively.
JOHN
Yes. I mean, it seems like a very light workload until assignment time
comes and then I seem to be working all night sometimes. I'm not the only
one. It's ridiculous. The resource centre is very good but it closes so early.
It's in the library and so you'd think you could use it more. It's a real
problem for me.
COUNSELLOR Well, you're certainly not the only person in that position, as I'm sure
you've found. It really comes down to using every available hour in a

Q22

Q23

systematic way. If you do this with a plan, then you'll find that you still
have time for yourself and your hobbies as well.
JOHN
Yeah. I've heard from Thomas that you made him a sort of plan like this,
and he's going away for the weekend with all his work handed in, whereas I
haven't even started.
COUNSELLOR I need to find out a few more things about you first. I'll give you this form
to fill in about your lectures and things before you leave.
COUNSELLOR Now, what are your main problems?
JOHN
Well, what most concerns me is I'm still not doing very well in my
assignments.
COUNSELLOR Well, I know that you plan your writing carefully, but this can come to
nothing if the assignment doesn't answer the question. That really is the
key. You must read the question carefully and give it a great deal of
thought before you even start planning or writing your first draft. It's also
vital to check your work for errors. Everybody makes them, and they can
influence the person marking the work. So, always take time at the end to
check what you have written.
JOHN
As far as listening is concerned, I find it hard to keep up sometimes in
lectures, especially two-hour ones. I sometimes just seem to go off into a
dream.
COUNSELLOR It's a good idea to find out from your lecturers if they mind you recording
the lectures. You only need one of those small cassette recorders. The
quality is pretty good and a second listening can really clarify things.
Something else you can do is check your notes with a friend after the
lecture.
JOHN
Yes. That's a good idea. Thanks. It's hard to do all that all the time though,
especially when there's so much reading to do.
COUNSELLOR Yes. It's important, though, not to confine yourself to reading on your
subject. You should also read things of general interest that appeal to you.
You know, novels, newspapers, that kind of thing. Do you have a good
dictionary?
JOHN
Not really. I've never bothered with one
COUNSELLOR Mmmm. It would probably be a good idea to get one. Dictionaries are not
expensive and they can help a lot. Also you can underline or highlight new
words and . . .

SECTION 4
TUTOR Well, good afternoon. In today's session John Upton will be sharing some of the
findings of his research project from last term. John . . .
JOHN Thanks. Well, first of all, a little bit about the background to the project. Our
title, as you can see, is pretty straightforward: 'car safety'. But these days there's a
lot more to it than the usual injunctions about drinking and driving or speeding.

Q30

I had been interested and horrified by several newspaper reports on what people
call 'road rage'. For example the famous incident of a man getting out of his car
in a car park and hitting the driver of a van who had overtaken him earlier. It
seemed to me that there were almost as many serious problems when cars were
parked . . . i.e. were stationary . . . as when they were travelling at 90 miles an
hour. So I decided to make this the focus of the project.
For our research we depended mainly on talking to individuals, asking them
questions rather than using written questionnaires. We stopped people at a
selected garage on the motorway over a two-day period, and asked them
questions about what they'd observed or experienced themselves. Our
respondents were both men and women, but the women were just slightly in the
majority. We were pleased by the public's willingness to stop and chat to us . . . in
the end we talked to a total of 135 drivers over those two days.
So what were our findings? Well, as you can see, 93% of respondents had had
some kind of problem. A surprisingly large percentage - 24% had had their car
damaged in some way, but the main type of incident was being shouted
at - 79% had experienced that. 15% had experienced violence on their own
persons . . . they'd actually been hit by someone. The police tended only to be
informed when there was physical violence involved.
So what strategies had people developed to ensure their own safety? Let's have a
look at the figures here. Well, first of all, it was quite striking that there were often
distinct answers from the men and women. It was mainly women, for example,
who said one shouldn't ever stop to find out how to get somewhere. Whereas it
was men who said you should try to avoid looking directly at other drivers. Both
men and . . . oh sorry n o . . . it was women who said you had to tell someone
when you were due to get to a particular destination. Then, I had thought that it
would be mainly men, but both sexes made the point that it's much safer to get
keys out well in advance as you go towards your car. Men were very aware that
muggers or whatever might be concealed behind the car. They also made the
point that you should leave plenty of room when you park your car so you can
make a quick getaway if you need to. Finally, locking doors at all times . . . men
didn't think it was quite as important as women, but both gave it a high safety
rating.
When we asked them what they thought the best improvements had been in the
last five years in helping with road rage problems . . .

The chart shows that the percentage of British households with a range of consumer
durables steadily increased between 1972 and 1983. The greatest increase was in
telephone ownership, rising from 42% in 1972 to 77% in 1983. Next came centralheating ownership, rising from 37% of households in 1972 to 64% in 1983. The
percentage of households with a refrigerator rose 2 1 % over the same period and of
those with a washing machine by 14%. Households with vacuum-cleaners.
televisions and dishwashers increased by 8%, 5% and 2% respectively. In 1983. the
year of their introduction, 18% of households had a video recorder.
The significant social changes reflected in the statistics are that over the period the
proportion of British houses with central heating rose from one to two thuds, and of
those with a phone from under a half to over three-quarters. Together with the big
increases in the ownership of washing machines and refrigerators, they are evidence
of both rising living standards and the trend to lifestyles based on comfort and
convenience.

believe that child-rearing should be the responsibility of both parents and that,
| whilst the roles within that partnership may be different, they are nevertheless equal
in importance. In some societies, it has been made easier over the years for single
parents to raise children on their own. However, this does not mean that the
traditional family, with both parents providing emotional support and role-models for
their children, is not the most satisfactory way of bringing up children.
Of crucial importance, in my opinion, is how we define 'responsible for bringing the
children up'. At its simplest, it could mean giving the financial support necessary to
provide a home, food and clothes and making sure the child is safe and receives an
adequate education. This would be the basic definition.
There is, however, another possible way of defining that part of the quotation. That
would say it is not just the fathers responsibility to provide the basics for his children, ;
while his wife involves herself in the everyday activity of bringing them up. Rather, he
should share those daily duties, spend as much time as his job allows with his
children, play with them, read to them, help directly with their education, participate
very fully in their lives and encourage them to share his.
It is this second, fuller, concept of 'fatherhood' that I am in favour of, although I also
realise how difficult it is to achieve sometimes. The economic and employment
situation in many countries means that jobs are getting more, not less, stressful,
requiring long hours and perhaps long journeys to work as well. Therefore it may
remain for many a desirable ideal rather than an achievable reality.

Of course it goes without saying that prevention is better than cure. That is why, in
recent years, there has been a growing body of opinion in favour of putting more
resources into health education and preventive measures. The argument is that
ignorance of, for example, basic hygiene or the dangers of an unhealthy diet or
lifestyle needs to be combatted by special nationwide publicity campaigns, as well as
longer-term health education.

The chart shows the number of hours of leisure enjoyed by men and women in a
typical week in 1998-9, according to gender and employment status.
Among those employed full-time, men on average had fifty hours of leisure, whereas
women had approximately thirty-seven hours. There were no figures given for male
part-time workers, but female part-timers had forty hours of leisure time, only slightly
more than women in full-time employment, perhaps reflecting their work in the home.

Obviously,there is a strong human argument for catching any medical condition as
early as possible. There is also an economic argument for doing so. Statistics
demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of treating a condition in the early stages, rather
than delaying until more expensive and prolonged treatment is necessary. Then there
are social or economic costs, perhaps in terms of loss of earnings for the family
concerned or unemployed benefit paid by the state.

In the unemployed and retired categories, leisure time showed an increase for both
sexes, as might have been expected. Here too, men enjoyed more leisure time over eighty hours, compared with seventy hours for women, perhaps once again
reflecting the fact that women spend more time working in the home than men.
Lastly, housewives enjoyed approximately fifty-four hours of leisure, on average.
There were no figures given for househusbands! Overall, the chart demonstrates
that in the categories for which statistics on male leisure time were available, men
enjoyed at least ten hours of extra leisure time.

•

So far so good, but the difficulties start when we try to define what the 'proportion' of
the budget "should be, particularly if the funds will be 'diverted from treatment'.
Decisions on exactly how much of the total health budget should be spent in this way '
are not a matter for the non-specialist, but should be made on the basis of an
accepted health service model.
This is the point at which real problems occur - the formulation of the model. How do
we accurately measure which health education campaigns are effective in both
medical and financial terms? How do we agree about the medical efficacy of various
screening programmes,
for example, when the medical establishment itself does not
agree? A very rigorous process of evaluation is called for, so that we can make
informed decisions.

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 8 score. Here is the examiner's
comment:

The task is competently reported, although some details are ignored. The message is clear and there
is good use of cohesive devices to organise points. Despite some minor errors in spelling and
agreement, a good range of structures is used.

This response is very fluent and well expressed in an appropriate register. A range of relevant issues
is skilfully presented and discussed. The argument is logically developed and well organised. A wide
range of structures and vocabulary are used appropriately and accurately with only minor flaws.

According to statistical Information, the main reason for traveling
abroad is holidays, business, and visits to friends and relatives. Indeed,
there is a steady increase in the number of holiday makers; while in
1996 there were about 17,896 of the sample in 1998 there were
20,700 of them. Moreover, with the Introduction of more countries
within the EC market, travelling for business has also increased.
Although there is not a big decrement 3,957 traveled abroad for
business during \998> compared with 3,249 in 1996. Finally, traveling
abroad for visiting friends and relatives shows a steady Increase over
the period 1994—1998. While there were about 2,628 travelers in
1995 in 1998 the number increased to 3,181 in 1998. Consequently,
there is a steady increase in three main reasons for travelling abroad;
Holidays, business, or to visit relatives and friends.

Before talking about the essential role of death penalty, you have to think about the
meaning, and the purpose, of any kind of punishment. If you consider that the purpose
is to prevent the guilty from being nasty again, you can be seduced by an
argumentation in favour of the suppression of capital punishment. But you have to
think about another aspect of the problem: a punishment is also useful to impress
people, to make them fear the law. In fact, let's take the example of a young misfit,
which has grown in a violent atmosphere, influenced by older delinquents, e t c . . . He
lives in the streets, he's got no aim but to survive. This is the kind of person who
could possibly kill someone for money, or even for f u n . . . Why would he fear prison?
Life would be easier for him there. In addition, in many cases, when you behave
normally, you can benefit from penalty reductions. This young misfit needs to be
impressed, he needs to know that the law is a frontier. When you cross it, you can
lose your life. That is why capital punishment helps keeping a distance between
robbery and murder. If you abolish it, you suppress the difference between these two
types of crime, which are completely different.

In addition, there is also an Increased change in the destinations which
people tend to prefer for travelling. The area which appear to be more
popular among travellers is Western Europe. Indeed, while in 1994 only
19,371 of the sample preferred to spend their holiday (or other
reasons) in t h a t main region, there was an increase to 24,519 in 1998.
North America and other areas appeared also favourable. In 1996,
there were 1,167 going to North America and 1,905 to other areas.
These numbers increased to 1,823 and 2,486 accordingly. Statistical
figures prove that Western Europe seems to be the most favourable
place for holiday makers while North America and other areas follow
behind.

But there is also a limit to define: even if death penalty is unavoidable, it would be a
crime to apply it to inadequate cases. If there is no premeditation or past facts which
can justify such a punishment, it is far too strict to apply death penalty. That is why
the lawmakers have to establish precisely the context in which capital punishment car
be pronounced. That is the price to pay to limit violence without using excessive
violence...

The table shows that the figures for imprisonment in the five countries mentioned
indicate no overall pattern of increase or decrease. In fact there is considerable
fluctuation from country to country.

It is certainly true that the position of women in society has undergone a dramatic
change in the past twenty years but I do not feel that this is a direct cause of the
indisputable increase in juvenile-related problems during this period.

In Great Britain the numbers in prison have increased steadily from 30 000 in 1930
to 80,000 in 1980. On the other hand in Australia, and particularly in New Zealand
the numbers fell markedly from 1930 to 1940. Since then they have increased
gradually, apart from in 1980 when the numbers in prison in New Zealand fell by
about 30,000 from the 1970 total. Canada is the only country in which the numbers
in prison have decreased over the period 1930 to 1980, although there have been
fluctuations in this trend. The figures for the United States indicate the greatest
number of prisoners compared to the other four countries but population size needs
to be taken into account in this analysis. The prison population in the United States
increased rapidly from 1970 to 1980 and this must be a worrying trend.

It is now accepted that young women should find work on leaving school; indeed to
rely totally on their parents' financial support is no longer an option in many families.
Likewise, once they get married, the majority of women continue working since the
financial pressures of setting up a house and establishing a reasonable standard of
living often require two incomes.
Twenty years ago it was common for women to give up work once they had children
and devote their time to caring for their children. This is no longer the general rule
and the provision of professionally-run child care facilities and day nurseries have
removed much of the responsibility for child rearing that used to fall to mothers.
However, these facilities come at a cost and often require two salaries coming into a
family to be afforded.
I do not believe that the increase in the number of working mothers has resulted in
children being brought up less well than previously. Indeed it could be argued that by
giving mothers the opportunity to work and earn extra money children can be better
provided for than previously. There is more money for luxuries and holidays and a
more secure family life is possible. Of course there are limits as to the amount of time
that ideally should be spent away from home and the ideal scenario would be for one
of the parents (often the wife) to have a part-time job and thus be available for their
children before and after school. It is important to establish the correct balance
between family life and working life.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing this letter to explain why I have been unable to return the three books
have out on three-day loan, which are now overdue. After taking the books out on
16th March, I had an urgent phone call from my elderly aunt's neighbour to say that
my aunt had had a fall and had been taken into hospital. I am her only surviving
relative in this country, so I felt I had to go and see her immediately. I travelled down
to Surrey the following morning, thinking I would stay for only two or three days.
Unfortunately, my aunt's condition has only improved very slowly, so I have had to
stay here longer than expected. However, the hospital says that if all goes well, she
should be able to go home in two or three days' time, in which case I will be back at
the beginning of next week.
Dealing in mind the circumstances I trust you will kindly waive any fines that may
have accumulated.
Yours sincerely

It is certainly very understandable that some governments should start looking at
ways of limiting their populations to a sustainable figure. In the past, populations
were partly regulated by frequent war and widespread disease, but in recent years
the effects of those factors have been diminished. Countries can be faced with a
population that is growing much faster than she nation's food resources or
employment opportunities and whose members can be condemned to poverty by the
need to feed extra mouths. They identify population control as a'means to raising
living standards.
But how should it be achieved? Clearly, this whole area is a very delicate personal
and cultural issue. Many people feel that this is not a matter for the state. They feel
this is one area of life where they have the right to make decisions for themselves.
For that reason, it would seem that the best. approach would be to work by
persuasion rather than compulsion This could be done by a process of education
that points out the way a smaller family can mean an improved quality of life for the
family members, as well as less strain on the country's perhaps very limited,
resources.
This is the preferred way. Of course if this docs not succeed within a reasonable
time scale, it may be necessary to consider other measures. such as tax incentives
or child-benefit payments for small families only. These are midway between
persuasion and compulsion
So. yes. it is sometimes necessary, but governments should try very hard to
persuade first. They should also remember that this is a very delicate area indeed,
and that social engineering can create as many problems as it solves?

slightly from the overall fluency.

Dear Sirs,
I was one of the passengers who took the flight from Narita
(Tokyo) to Heathrow (London) on 5 August. Unfortunately, my
suitcase did not come out after the flight. Although I have explained
this Mr. McDonald who was in charge at the Luggage Claim Office
I have not heard from him as of now.
My suit case is grey Samsonite whose size is 10 x 95 cm. There are
3 steckers on one side and 1 heart shaped stecker on the other side.
My initials "AR" are also written on both sides.
There are a few books and a copy of my thesis in that suitcase,
which I need for the conference on 19 August.
So I would deeply appreciate it if you could give me a prompt reply
at your most convenient. My flight number, luggage claim number
and address are written below.
Flight No : NH 101
Luggage Claim No : 00026
Address : 6H Silver Street
London.NWI6 5AL
Yours Faithfully.

This response is underlength and is marked down because of this. Only a few relevant ideas are
presented and these are used rather repetitively and are insufficiently developed or supported.
However, the writing communicates fluently and a satisfactory range of structures and vocabulary
are used.

I am not surprise when I read in the newspapers that many people move
to English speaking countries. I am an engineer in a process control
since ten years and I understand the necessity of English language.
For example, when I read technical English specifications, when I meet
Japanese Industrials to build together some electronic materials or
when I go on holidays in Italy where the best way (for me) to
communicate is to speak English. Therefore, today, it's necessary to
learn English and the best way is to study in English as soon as
possible when we are at school but also when we have a job. It's so
Important to communicate with foreigners, because of work. For
example: to seafoods in USA, to build electronic cards with the
Japanese, to obtain a certification with FDA (American organization)
in order to sell some pharmaceutical products. In fact, jt's Important

for everybody, the workers, the visitors, the scientists, etc ...
These are the main reason which explain why so many people go to
English speaking countries (the best way to learn) and why English is
such an Important International language (the communication between
many the people over the world).
