READING PASSAGE 2ï¿½

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2

below.

Nature or Nurture?

A Atfew years ago, in one of the most fascinating and disturbing experiments in behavioural
psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects from ail walks of life for
their willingness to obey instructions given by a ï¿½leaderï¿½ in a situation in which the subjects
might fee! a personal distaste for the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically,
Milgram told each volunteer 'teacher-subjectï¿½ that the experiment was in the noble cause of
education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes
would have a positive effect on the pupilsï¿½ ability to learn.

B _Milgramï¿½s experimental set-up involved placing the teacher-subject before a panel of thirty
switches with labels ranging from ï¿½15 volts of electricity (slight shock)ï¿½ to ï¿½450 volts
(danger ï¿½ severe shock)ï¿½ in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that
whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered,
beginning at the lowest level and increasing in severity with each successive wrong
answer. The supposed ï¿½pupilï¿½ was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to simulate receiving
the shocks by emitting a spectrum of groans, screams and writhings together with an
assortment of statements and expletives denouncing both the experiment and the
experimenter. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to
administer whatever level of shock was called for, as per the rule governing the
experimental situation of the moment.

C As the experiment unfolded, the pupil would deliberately give the wrong answers to
questions posed by the teacher, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even
up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects balked at
administering the higher !evels of punishment, and turned to Milgram with questioning
looks and/or complaints about continuing the experiment. In these situations, Milgram
calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to ignore the pupil's cries for mercy and
carry on with the experiment. If the subject was still reluctant to proceed, Milgram said that
it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to
the end. His final argument was, ï¿½You have no other choice. You must go on.' What Milgram
was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to
administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral
revulsion against the rules and conditions of the experiment.

D Prior to carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of
39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people in an
ordinary population who wauld be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts.
The overwhelming consensus was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to
obey the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that ï¿½most subjects would not go beyond
150 voitsï¿½ and they further anticipated that only four per cent would go up to 300 volts.

20
" "Reading
Furthermore, they thought that only a lunatic fringe of about one in 1,000 would give the
highest shock of 450 volts. .

E What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to
obey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! In repetitions of the experiment in other countries, the
percentage of obedient teacher-subjects was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one
country, How can we possibly account for this vast discrepancy between what calm,
tational, knowledgeable people predict in the comfort of their study and what pressured,
flustered, but cooperative ï¿½teachersï¿½ actually do in the laboratory of reat life?

F One's first inclination might be to argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal
aggression instinct that was activated by the experiment, and that Milgramï¿½s teacher-
subjects were just following a genetic need to discharge this pent-up primal urge onto the
Pupil by administering the electrical shock. A modern hard-core sociobiologist might even
go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct evolved as an advantageous trait, having
been of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the
plains and in the caves, ultimately finding its way into our genetic make-up as a remnant of
our ancient animal ways.

G  Analternative to this notion of genetic programming is to see the teacher-subjects' actions
as a result of the social environment under which the experiment was Carried out. As
Milgram himself pointed out, 'Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a
larger context that is benevolent and useful to society - the pursuit of scientific truth. The
psychological laboratory has a strong claim to legitimacy and evokes trust and confidence
in those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which in isolation appears
evil, acquires a completely different meaning when piaced in this setting.ï¿½

H_ Thus, in this explanation the subject merges his unique personality and personal and moral
code with that of larger institutional structures, surrendering individual properties like
loyalty, self-sacrifice and discipline to the service of malevolent systems of authority.

| Here we have two radically different explanations for why so many teacher-subjects were
willing to forgo their sense of personal responsibility for the sake of an institutional authority
figure. The problem for biologists, psychologists and anthropologists is to sort out which of
these two polar explanations is more plausible. This, in essence, is the problem of modern
sociobjology - to discover the degree to which hard-wired genetic programming dictates,
or at least strongly biases, the interaction of animais and humans with their environment,

that is, their behaviour. Put another way, sociobiology is concerned with elucidating the
biological basis of all behaviour.

below.

SMe lol me hes

For many environmentalists, the world seems to be getting worse. They have developed
a hit-list of our main fears; that natural resources are running out; that the population is
ever growing, leaving less and less to eat; that species are becoming extinct in vast
numbers, and that the planet's air and water are becoming ever more polluted.
But a quick look at the facts shows a different picture, First, energy and other natural
resources have become more abundant, not less so, since the book ï¿½The Limits to
Growthï¿½ was published in 1972 by a group of scientists. Second, more food is now
produced per head of the worldï¿½s population than at any time in history. Fewer people
are starving. Third, although species are indeed becoming extinct, only about 0.7% of
them are expected to disappear in the next 50 years, not 25-50%, as has so often been
predicted. And finally, most forms of environmental pollution either appear to have
been exaggerated, or are transient ï¿½ associated with the early phases of industrialisation
and therefore best cured not by restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it. One
form of pollution - the release of greenhouse gases that causes global warming ï¿½ does
appear to be a phenomenon that is going to extend well into our future, but its total
impact is unlikely to pose a devastating problem. A bigger problem may well turn out to
be an inappropriate response to it.
Yet opinion polls suggest that many people nurture the belief that environmental
standards are declining and four factors seem to cause this disjunction between
perception and reality.
One is the lopsidedness built into scientific research. Scientific funding goes mainly to
areas with many problems. That may be wise policy, but it will also create an impression
that many more potential problems exist than is the case.
Secondly, environmental groups need to be noticed by the mass media. They also need
to keep the money rolling in. Understandably, perhaps, they sometimes overstate their
arguments. In 1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press
release entitled: ï¿½Two thirds of the worldï¿½s forests lost foreverï¿½. The truth turns out to
be nearer 20%,
Though these groups are run overwhelmingly by selfless folk, they nevertheless share
many of the characteristics of other lobby groups. That would matter less if people
applied the same degree of scepticism to environmental lobbying as they do to lobby
groups in other fields. A trade organisation arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is
instantly seen as self-interested. Yet a green organisation opposing such a weakening is

24
" "Reading
seen as altruistic, even if an impartial view of the controls in question might suggest
they are doing more harm than good.

A third source of confusion is the attitude of the media. People are clearly more curious
about bad news than good. Newspapers and broadcasters are there to provide what the
public wants. That, however, can lead to significant distortions of perception. An
example was Americaï¿½s encounter with Et Nifio in 1997 and 1998. This climatic
phenomenon was accused of wrecking tourism, causing allergies, metting the ski-slopes
and causing 22 deaths. However, according to an article in the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society, the damage it did was estimated at US$4 billion but the benefits
amounted to some US$19 billion. These came from higher winter temperatures (which
saved an estimated 850 lives, reduced heating costs and diminished spring floods caused
by meltwaters).

The fourth factor is poor individual perception. People worry that the endless rise in the
amount of stuff everyone throws away will cause the world to run out of places to
dispose of waste. Yet, even if Americaï¿½s trash output continues to rise as it has done in
the past, and even if the American population doubles by 2100, all the rubbish America
produces through the entire 21st century will still take up only one-12,000th of the area
of the entire United States.

So what of global warming? As we know, carbon dioxide emissions are causing the
planet to warm. The best estimates are that the temperatures will rise by 2-3ï¿½C in this
century, causing considerable problems, at a total cost of US$5,000 billion.

Despite the intuition that something drastic needs to be done about such a costly
problem, economic analyses clearly show it will be far more expensive to cut carbon
dioxide emissions radically than to pay the costs of adaptation to the increased
temperatures. A model by one of the main authors of the United Nations Climate
Change Panel shows how an expected temperature increase of 2.1 degrees in 2100
would only be diminished to an increase of 1.9 degrees. Or to put it another way, the
temperature increase that the planet would have experienced in 2094 would be
postponed to 2100.

So this does not prevent global warming, but merely buys the world six years. Yet the .
cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for the United States alone, will be higher
than the cost of solving the worldï¿½s single, most pressing health problem: providing
universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Such measures would avoid

2 million deaths every year, and prevent half a billion people from becoming seriously ill.
Itis crucial that we look at the facts if we want to make the best possible decisions for
the future. It may be costly to be overly optimistic ï¿½ but more costly still to be too
pessimistic.

BAK SLITS
The birth of modern plastics
In 1907, Leo Hendrick Baekeland, a Belgian scientist working in New York, discovered and
patented a revolutionary new synthetic material. His invention, which he named ï¿½Bakeliteï¿½,
was of enormous technological importance, and effectively launched the modern plastics
Industry.
The term ï¿½plasticï¿½ comes frorn the Greek plassein, meaning ï¿½to mouldï¿½. Some plastics are
derived from natural sources, some are semi-synthetic (the result of chemical action on a
natural substance), and some are entirely synthetic, that is, chemically engineered from the
constituents of coal or ail. Same are ï¿½thermoplasticï¿½, which means that, like candlewax, they
melt when heated and can then be reshaped. Others are ï¿½thermosettingï¿½: like eggs, they
cannot revert to their original viscous state, and their shape is thus fixed for ever. Bakelite had
the distinction of being the first totally synthetic thermosetting plastic.
The history of todayï¿½s plastics begins with the discovery of a series of semi-synthetic
thermoplastic materials in the mid-nineteenth century. The impetus behind the development
of these early plastics was generated by a number of factors ï¿½ immense technological
progress in the domain of chemistry, coupled with wider cultural changes, and the pragmatic
need to find acceptable substitutes for dwindling supplies of ï¿½luxuryï¿½ materials such as
tortoiseshell and ivory.
Baekeland's interest in plastics began in 1885 when, as a young chemistry student in
Belgium, he embarked on research into phenolic resins, the group of sticky substances
produced when phenol (carbolic acid) combines with an aldehyde (a volatile fluid similar to
alcohol). He soon abandoned the subject, however, only returning to it some years later. By
1905 he was a wealthy New Yorker, having recently made his fortune with the invention of a
new photographic paper. While Baekeland had been busily amassing dollars, some advances
had been made in the development of plastics. The years 1899 and 1900 had seen the
patenting of the first semi-synthetic thermosetting material that could be manufactured on
an industrial scale. In purely scientific terms, Baekelandï¿½s major contribution to the field is not
so much the actual discovery of the material to which he gave his name, but rather the
method by which a reaction between phenol and formaldehyde could be controlled, thus
38
" "Reading
making possible its preparation on a commercial basis. On 13 July 1907, Baekeland took out
his famous patent describing this preparation, the essential features of which are still in use
today,

The original patent outlined a three-stage process, in which pheno! and formaldehyde
(from wood or coal) were initially combined under vacuum inside a large egg-shaped kettle.
The result was a resin known as Novalak, which became soluble and malleable when heated.
The resin was allowed to cool in shallow trays until it hardened, and then broken up and
ground into powder. Other substances were then introduced: including fillers, such as
woodflour, asbestos or cotton, which increase strength and moisture resistance, catalysts
(substances to speed up the reaction between two chemicals without joining to either) and
hexa, a compound of ammonia and formaldehyde which supplied the additional
formaldehyde necessary to form a thermosetting resin. This resin was then left to cool and
harden, and ground up a second time. The resulting granular powder was raw Bakelite, ready
to be made into a vast range of manufactured objects. In the last stage, the heated Bakelite
was poured jnto a hollow mould of the required shape and subjected to extreme heat and
pressure, thereby ï¿½settingï¿½ its form for life.
The design of Bakelite objects, everything from earrings to television sets, was governed to a
large extent by the technical requirements of the moulding process. The object could not be
designed so that it was locked into the mould and therefore difficult to extract. A common
general rule was that objects should taper towards the deepest part of the mould, and if
necessary the product was moulded in separate pieces. Moulds had to be carefully designed
so that the molten Bakelite would flow evenly and completely into the mould. Sharp corners
proved impractical and were thus avoided, giving rise to the smooth, ï¿½streamlinedï¿½ style
popular in the 1930s. The thickness of the walls of the mould was also crucial: thick wails
took longer to cool and harden, a factor which had to be considered by the designer in order
to make the most efficient use of machines.
Baekelandï¿½s invention, although treated with disdain in its early years, went on to enjoy an
unparalleled popularity which lasted throughout the first half of the twentieth century. It
became the wonder product of the new world of industrial expansion ï¿½ ï¿½the material of a
thousand usesï¿½. Being both non-porous and heat-resistant, Bakelite kitchen goods were
promoted as being germ-free and sterilisable. Electrical manufacturers seized on its insulating
properties, and consumers everywhere relished its dazzling array of shades, delighted that
they were now, at last, no longer restricted to the wood tones and drab browns of the pre-
plastic era. It then fell from favour again during the 1950s, and was despised and destroyed
in vast quantities. Recently, however, it has been experiencing something of a renaissance,
with renewed demand for original Bakelite objects in the collectorsï¿½ marketplace, and
museums, societies and dedicated individuals once again appreciating the style and originality
of this innovative material.

John McCrone reviews recent research on humour
The joke comes over the headphones: ï¿½Which side of a dog has the most hair? The left.ï¿½
No, not funny. Try again. ï¿½Which side of a dog has the most hair? The outside.ï¿½ Hah! The
punchline is silly yet fitting, tempting a smile, even a laugh, Laughter has always struck
people as deeply mysterious, perhaps pointless, The writer Arthur Koestler dubbed it the
luxury reflex: ï¿½unique in that it serves no apparent biological purposeï¿½.
Theories about humour have an ancient pedigree. Plato expressed the idea that humour is
simply a delighted feeling of superiority over others. Kant and Freud felt that joke-telling
relies on building up a psychic tension which is safely punctured by the ludicrousness of
the punchline. But most modern humour theorists have settled on some version of
Aristotleï¿½s belief that jokes are based on a reaction to or resolution of incongruity, when the
punchline is either a nonsense or, though appearing silly, has a clever second meaning.
Graeme Ritchie, a computational linguist in Edinburgh, studies the linguistic structure of
jokes in order to understand not only humour but language understanding and reasoning
in machines. He says that while there is no single format for jokes, many revolve around a
sudden and surprising conceptual shift. A comedian will present a situation followed by an
unexpected interpretation that is also apt.
So even if a punchline sounds silly, the listener can see there is a clever semantic fit and
that sudden mental ï¿½Aha!ï¿½ is the buzz that makes us laugh. Viewed from this angle, humour
is just a form of creative insight, a sudden leap to a new perspective.
However, there is another type of laughter, the laughter of social appeasement and it is
important to understand this too, Play is a crucial part of development in most young
mammals. Rats produce ultrasonic squeaks to prevent their scuffles turning nasty.
Chimpanzees have a ï¿½play-faceï¿½ - a gaping expression accompanied by a panting ï¿½ah, ahï¿½
noise. In humans, these signals have mutated into smiles and laughs. Researchers believe
social situations, rather than cognitive events such as jokes, trigger these instinctual
markers of play or appeasement. People laugh on fairground rides or when tickled to flag a
play situation, whether they feel amused or not.
Both social and cognitive types of laughter tap into the same expressive machinery in our
brains, the emotion and motor circuits that produce smiles and excited vocalisations.
However, if cognitive laughter is the product of more general thought processes, it should
result from more expansive brain activity.
43
" "Test 2

Psychologist Vinod Goel investigated humour using the new technique of ï¿½single eventï¿½
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An MRi scanner uses magnetic fields and
radio waves to track the changes in oxygenated blood that accompany mental activity.
Until recently, MRI scanners needed several minutes of activity and so cauld not be used to
track rapid thought processes such as comprehending a joke. New developments now
allow half-second ï¿½snapshotsï¿½ of all sorts of reasoning and problem-solving activities.
Although Goel felt being inside a brain scanner was hardly the ideal place for appreciating
a joke, he found evidence that understanding a joke involves a widespread mental shift. His
scans showed that at the beginning of a joke the listener's prefrontal cortex lit up,
particularly the right prefrontal believed to be critical for problem solving. But there was
also activity in the temporal lobes at the side of the head (consistent with attempts to rouse
stored knowledge) and in many other brain areas. Then when the punchline arrived, a new
area sprang to life ï¿½- the orbital prefrontal cortex. This patch of brain tucked behind the
orbits of the eyes is associated with evaluating information.

Making a rapid emotional assessment of the events of the moment is an extremely
demanding job for the brain, animal or human. Energy and arousal levels may need to be
retuned in the blink of an eye. These abrupt changes will produce either positive or
negative feelings. The orbital cortex, the region that becomes active in Goelï¿½s experiment,
seems the best candidate for the site that feeds such feelings into higher-level thought
processes, with its close connections to the brainï¿½s sub-cortical arousal apparatus and
centres of metabolic control.

All warm-blooded animals make constant tiny adjustments in arousal in response to
external events, but humans, who have developed a much more complicated internal life
as a result of language, respond emotionally not only to their surroundings, but to their
own thoughts. Whenever a sought-for answer snaps into place, there is a shudder of
pleased recognition. Creative discovery being pleasurable, humans have learned to find
ways of milking this natural response. The fact that jokes tap into our general evaluative
machinery explains why the line between funny and disgusting, or funny and frightening,
can be so fine. Whether a joke gives pleasure or pain depends on a personï¿½s outlook.
Humour may be a luxury, but the mechanism behind it is no evolutionary accident. As
Peter Derks, a psychologist at William and Mary College in Virginia, says: ï¿½| like to think of
humour as the distorted mirror of the mind. Itï¿½s creative, perceptual, analytical and lingual.
If we can figure out how the mind processes humour, then we'll have a pretty good handle
on how it works in general.ï¿½

rehabilitation of the term has a long way to go, and some firms still
prefer to avoid using it. But the fact that others are starting to use
it again suggests that Al has moved on from being seen as an over-
ambitious and under-achieving field of research.
B The field was launched, and the term ï¿½artificial intelligenceï¿½ coined, at a conference in 1956,by
a group of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Herbert Simon and Alan
Newell, all of whom went on to become leading figures in the field. The expression provided an
attractive but informative name for a research programme that encompassed such previously
disparate fields as operations research, cybernetics, logic and computer science. The goal they
shared was an attempt to capture or mimic human abilities using machines. That said, different
groups of researchers attacked different problems, from speech recognition to chess playing, in
different ways; Al unified the field in name only. But it was a term that captured the public
imagination.
C Most researchers agree that Al peaked around 1985. A public reared on science-fiction
movies and excited by the growing power of computers had high expectations. For years,
Al researchers had implied that a breakthrough was just around the corner. Marvin Minsky said
in 1967 that within a generation the problem of creating ï¿½artificial intelligenceï¿½ would be
substantially solved. Prototypes of medical-diagnosis programs and speech recognition software
appeared to be making progress. It proved to be a false dawn. Thinking computers and

household robots failed to materialise, and a backlash ensued. ï¿½There was undue optimism in the
early 1980s, says David Leake, a researcher at Indiana University. \"Then when people realised
these were hard problems, there was retrenchment. By the late |980s, the term Al was being
avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align themselves with specific sub-disciplines
such as neural networks, agent technology, case-based reasoning, and so on!

D Ironically, in some ways Al was a victim of its own success. Whenever an apparently mundane
problem was solved, such as building a system that could land an aircraft unattended, the
problem was deemed not to have been Al in the first place. ï¿½If it works, it canï¿½t be Al,ï¿½ as

Dr Leake characterises it. The effect of repeatedly moving the goal-posts in this way was that

Al came to refer to ï¿½blue-skyï¿½ research that was still years away from commercialisation,
Researchers jaked that Al stood for ï¿½almost implementedï¿½. Meanwhile, the technologies that
made it onto the market, such as speech recognition, language translation and decision-support
software, were no longer regarded as Al. Yet all three once fell well within the umbrella of

Al research.

E But the tide may now be turning, according to Dr Leake. HNC Software of San Diego, backed
by a government agency, reckon that their new approach to artificial intelligence is the most
powerful and promising approach ever discovered. HNC claim that their system, based ona
cluster of 30 processors, could be used to spot camouflaged vehicles on a battlefield or extract
a voice signal from a noisy background ï¿½ tasks humans can do well, but computers cannot.
ï¿½Whether or not their technology lives up to the claims made for it, the fact that HNC are
emphasising the use of Al is itself an interesting development, says Dr Leake.

F Another factor that may boost the prospects for Al in the near future is that investors are
now looking for firms using clever technology, rather than just a clever business model, to
differentiate themselves. In particular, the problem of information overload, exacerbated by the
growth of e-mail and the explosion in the number of web pages, means there are plenty of
opportunities for new technologies to help filter and categorise information ï¿½ classic Al
problems. That may mean that more artificial intelligence companies will start to emerge to
meet this challenge.

G The 1969 film, 2001:A Space Odyssey, featured an intelligent computer called HAL 9000. As
well as understanding and speaking English, HAL could play chess and even learned to lipread.
HAL thus encapsulated the optimism of the 1960s that intelligent computers would be
widespread by 2001. But 2001 has been and gone, and there is still no sign of a HAL-like
computer. Individual systems can play chess or transcribe speech, but a general theory of
machine intelligence still remains elusive. It may be, however, that the comparison with HAL no
longer seems quite so important, and Al can now be judged by what it can do, rather than by
how well it matches up to a 30-year-old science-fiction film. ï¿½People are beginning to realise that
there are impressive things that these systems can do, says Dr Leake hopefully.

The Impact of Wilderness Tourism
A
The market for tourism in remote areas is booming as never before. Countries ail
across the world are actively promoting their ï¿½wildernessï¿½ regions ï¿½ such as
mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands ï¿½ to high-spending
tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism
requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost.
As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
recognizeu, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures)
not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants.
The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in
terms of the proportion of the Earthï¿½s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and
Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh
conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human
activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.

Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the
unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these
isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ï¿½adventure touristï¿½, grateful for
the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime
source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in
the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas
such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona's Monument Valley.

B

Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local
community are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money
in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year
working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their
farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions,
this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet,
because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and
tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned
to outside supplies of rice and other foods.

In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on
hunting anima!s and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season.
However, as some inhabitants become involved in tourlsm, they no longer have
time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food
and stores. Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of
wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival
86
" "Reading
systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens if
these new, external sources of income dry up?

The physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the
growth In adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major
trails, but perhaps more important are the deforestation and impacts on water
supplies arising from the need to provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers.
In both mountains and deserts, slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel
and water supplies may be limited or vulnerable to degradation through heavy use.

c

Stories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet
it does not have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in
which it takes place, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures
can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures,
as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal's Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine
villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to ensure
that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long term.

In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on
integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about
the rising number of second home developments in the Swiss Pays dï¿½Enhaut
fesulted in limits being imposed on their growth. There has also been a
renaissance In communal cheese production In the area, providing the locals with
arellable source of income that does not depend on outside visitors.

Many of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside
companies, who employ transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to
their home base. But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses
themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native
corporation In Alaska, employing local people, Is running an alr tour from
Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food, walk on the tundra and
watch local musiclans and dancers.

Native people in the desert regions of the American Southwest have followed
similar strategies, encouraging tourists to visit their pueblos and reservations to
purchase high-quality handicrafts and artwork. The Acoma and San Ildefonso
pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, while the Navajo
and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with jewellery.

Too many people living in fragile environments have lost control over their
economies, their culture and their environment when tourism has penetrated their
homelands. Merely restricting tourism cannot be the solution to the imbalance,
because peopleï¿½s desire to see new places will not just disappear. Instead,
communities In fragile environments must achieve greater control over tourlsm
ventures in their regions, in order to balance their needs and aspirations with the
demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are demonstrating that,
with firm communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical question now is
whether this can become the norm, rather than the exception.

assist growth in plants.
Breeding in most organisms occurs during a part of the year only, and so a reliable cue is
needed to trigger breeding behaviour. Day length is an excellent cue, because it provides a
perfectly predictable pattern of change within the year. In the temperate zone in spring,
temperatures fluctuate greatly from day to day, but day length increases steadily by a
predictable amount. The seasonal impact of day length on physiological responses is called
photoperiodism, and the amount of experimental evidence for this phenomenon is
considerable. For example, some species of birdsï¿½ breeding can be induced even in midwinter
simply by increasing day length artificially (Wolfson 1964), Other examples of photoperiodism
occur in plants. A short-day plant flowers when the day is less than a certain critical length. A
long-day plant flowers after a certain critical day length is exceeded. In both cases the critical
day length differs from species to species. Plants which flower after a period of vegetative
growth, regardless of photoperiod, are known as day-neutral plants.
Breeding seasons in animals such as birds have evolved to occupy the part of the year in
which offspring have the greatest chances of survival. Before the breeding season begins, food
reserves must be built up to support the energy cost of reproduction, and to provide for
young birds both when they are in the nest and after fledging. Thus many temperate-zone
birds use the increasing day lengths in spring as a cue to begin the nesting cycle, because this
is a point when adequate food resources will be assured.
The adaptive significance of photoperiodism in plants is also clear. Short-day plants that
flower in spring in the temperate zone are adapted to maximising seedling growth during the
growing season. Long-day plants are adapted for situations that require fertilization by insects,
or a long period of seed ripening. Short-day plants that flower in the autumn in the
temperate zone are able to build up food reserves over the growing season and over winter
as seeds, Day-neutral plants have an evolutionary advantage when the connection between
the favourable period for reproduction and day length is much less certain. For example,
desert annuals germinate, flower and seed whenever suitable rainfall occurs, regardless of the
day length.

The breeding season of some plants can be delayed to extraordinary lengths. Bamboos are
perennial grasses that remain in a vegetative state for many years and then suddenly flower,
fruit and die (Evans 1976). Every bamboo of the species Chusquea abietifolia on the island
of Jamaica flowered, set seed and died during 1884. The next generation of bamboo flowered
and died between 1916 and 1918, which suggests a vegetative cycle of about 31! years. The
climatic trigger for this flowering cycle is not yet known, but the adaptive significance is clear.
The simultaneous production of masses of bamboo seeds (in some cases lying 12 to 15
centimetres deep on the ground) is more than all the seed-eating animals can cope with at
the time, so that some seeds escape being eaten and grow up to form the next generation
(Evans 1976).
The second reason light is important to organisms is that it is essential for photosynthesis. This
is the process by which plants use energy from the sun to convert carbon from soil or water
into organic material for growth. The rate of photosynthesis in a plant can be measured by
calculating the rate of its uptake of carbon. There is a wide range of photosynthetic
responses of plants to variations in light intensity. Some plants reach maximal photosynthesis
at one-quarter full sunlight, and others, like sugarcane, never reach a maximum, but continue
to Increase photosynthesis rate as light intensity rises.
Plants in general can be divided into two groups: shade-tolerant species and shade-intolerant
species. This classification is commonly used in forestry and horticulture. Shade-tolerant
plants have lower photosynthetic rates and hence have lower growth rates than those of
shade-intolerant species. Plant species become adapted to living in a certain kind of habitat,
and in the process evolve a series of characteristics that prevent them from occupying other
habitats. Grime (1966) suggests that light may be one of the major components directing
these adaptations. For example, eastern hemlock seedlings are shade-tolerant. They can
survive in the forest understorey under very low light levels because they have a low
photosynthetic rate.
