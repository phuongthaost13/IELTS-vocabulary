SYSTEMS   What have been the trends and what are the prospects for European transport systems   A Its difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system  Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices  the requirement for transport continues to increase  There are two key factors behind this trend  For passenger transport  the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use  The umber of cars on European Union  EU  roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from  to   and in the ext decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet   B As far as goods transport is concerned  growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production  In the last  years  as internal frontiers have been abolished  the EU has moved from a  stock  economy to a  flaw  economy  This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries  particularly those which are labour intensive  to reduce production costs  even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users     The strong economic growth expected in countries which are candidates for entry to the EU will also increase transport fiows  in particular road haulage traffic  In   some of these countries already exported more than twice their  volumes and imported more than five times their  volumes  And although many candidate countries inherited a transport system which encourages rail  the distribution between modes has tipped sharply in favour of road transport since the s  Between  and   road haulage increased by     while during the same period rail haulage decreased by     although   and this could benefit the enlarged EU   itis still on average at a much higher level than in existing member states   D However  a ew imperative   sustainable development   offers an opportunity for adapting the EU s common transport policy  This objective  agreed by the Gothenburg European Council  has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies  and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy  The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by   but proposed measures are onetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in  years  time  that is by      www irLanguage com  " "X Reading  E In   energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for   of emissions of C  the leading greenhouse gas  According to the latest estimates  if nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend  CO emissions from transport can be expected to increase by around   to   billion tonnes by   compared with the  billion tonnes recorded in   Once again  road transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for   of the CO emissions attributable to transport  Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge   F At the same time greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift  Such  change cannot be achieved overnight  all the less so after aver half a century of constant deterioration in favour of road  This has reached such a pitch that today rail freight services are facing marginalisation  with just   of market share  and with international goods trains struggling along at an average speed of km h  Three possible options have emerged   G The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing  This option would ot be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of transport  In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport  However  the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable mades of transport to take up the baton   H The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes  better quality of services  logistics  technology   However  this approach does ot include investment in ew infrastructure  or does it guarantee better regionel cohesion  It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach  but road transport would keep the lion s share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries  despite being the most polluting of the modes  It is therefore ot enough to guarantee the ecessary shift of the balance   I The third approach  which is ot ew  comprises a series of measures ranging from pricing to revitalising alternative modes of transport and targeting investment in the trans European etwork  This integrated approach would allaw the market  shares of the other mades to return to their  levels and thus make a shift of balance  It is far more ambitious than it looks  bearing in mind the historical imbalance in favour of roads for the last fifty years  but would achieve a marked break in the link between road transport growth and economic growth  without placing restrictions on the mobility of people and goods    www irLanguage com  " "X Test  Questions   Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage   In boxes   on

Revolution in Britain  Anjana Abuja reports  A Alan Macfarlane  professor of anthropological science at King s College  Cambridge  has  like other historians  spent decades wrestling with the enigma of the Industrial Revolution  Why  did this particular Big Bang   the world changing birth of industry   happen in Britain  And why did it strike at the end of the th century   B Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock   There are about  different factors and all of them eed to be present before the revolution can happen   he says  For industry to take off  there eeds to be the technology and power to drive factories  large urban populations to provide cheap labour  easy transport to move goods around  an affluent middle class willing to buy mass produced objects  a market driven economy and a political system that allows this to happen  While this was the case for England  other nations  such as Japan  the Netherlands and France also met some of these criteria but were not industrialising   All these factors must have been ecessary but ot sufficient to cause the revolution   says Macfarlane   After all  Holland had everything except coal  while China also had many of these factors  Most historians are convinced there are one or two missing factors that you eed to open the lock      The missing factors  he proposes  are to be found in almost every kitchen cupboard  Tea and beer  cwo of the ation s favourite drinks  fuelled the revolution  The antiseptic properties of tannin  the active ingredient in tea  and of hops in beer   plus the fact that both are made with boiled water   allowed urban communities to fourish at close quarters without succumbing to water borne diseases such as dysentery  The theory sounds eccentric but once he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction  the scepticism gives  way to wary admiration  Macfarlane s case has been strengthened by support from otable quarters   Roy Porter  the distinguished medical historian  recently wrote a favourable appraisal of his research   D Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about  Historians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid th century that required explanation  Between about  and   the population in Britain was static  But then there was a burst in population growth  Macfarlane says   The infant mortality rate halved in the space of  years  and this happened in both rural areas and cities  and across all classes  People suggested four possible causes  Was there a sudden change in the viruses and bacteria around  Unlikely  Was there a revolution in medical science  But this was a century  before Lister s revolution   Was there a change in environmental conditions  There were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria  but these were small gains  Sanitation did ot become widespread until the th century  The only option left is food  Bur the height and weight statistics show a decline  So the food must have got worse  Efforts to explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank     eh eco dover te a hg g sg opens opinion    vw

it is economically efficient ro have people living close together  says Macfarlane   But then you get disease  particularly from human waste   Some digging around in historical records revealed that there was a change in the incidence of water borne disease at that time   specially dysentery  Macfarlane deduced that whatever the British were drinking must have been important in regulating disease  He says   We drank beet  For a long time  the English were protected by the strong antibacterial agent in hops  which were added to help preserve the beer  But in the late th century a tax was introduced on malt  the basic ingredient of beer  The poor turned to water and gin and in the s the mortality rate began to rise again  Then it suddenly dropped again  What caused this    F Macfarlane looked to Japan  which was also developing large cities about the same time  and also had o sanitation  Water borne diseases had a much looser grip on the Japanese population than those in Britain  Could it be the prevalence of tea in their culeure  Macfarlane then oted that the history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary coincidence of dates  Tea was relatively expensive until Britain started a direct clipper trade with China in che early th century  By the s  about the time chat infant mortality was dipping  the drink was common  Macfarlane guessed that the fact that water had to be boiled  rogether with the stomach purifying properties of tea meant that the breast milk provided by mothers was healthier than it had ever been  No other European ation sipped tea like the British  which  by Macfarlane  logic  pushed these other countries out of contention for the revolution   G Bus  iftea isa factor in the combination lock  why didn t Japan forge ahead in a cea soaked industrial revolution of its own  Macfarlane otes that even though th century Japan had large cities  high literacy rates  even a futures marker  it had turned its back on the essence of any work based revolution by giving up labour saving devices such as animals  afraid that they would put people out of work  So  the ation that we ow think of as one of the most technologically advanced

spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on  Reading Passage  below     Gifted children and learning    A Internationally   giftedness  is most frequently determined by a score ona   general intelligence test  known as an IO test  which is above a chosen cut   i off point  usually at around the top     Children s educational environment    contributes to the IQ score and the way intelligence is used  For example    a very close positive relationship was found when children s IQ scores were i compared with their home educational provision  Freeman     The higher the children s IO scores  especially over IQ   the better the quality of their educational backup  measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with parents  umber of books and activities in their home etc  Because IQ tests are decidedly influenced by what the child has learned  they are tosomeextent measures of current achievement based on age orms  that is  how wellthe children have learned to manipulate their knowledge and know how within the   terms of the test  The vocabulary aspect  for example  is dependent on having   heard those words  But IO tests can either identify the processes of learning and thinking or predict creativity   B  Excellence does ot emerge without appropriate help  To reach an exceptionally high standard in any area very able children eed the means to learn  which includes material to work with and focused challenging tuition  and the encouragement to follow their dream  There appears to be a qualitative difference in the way the intellectually highly able think  compared   with more average ability or older pupils  for whom external regulation by the i teacher often compensates for lack of internal regulation  To be at their most  effective in their self regulation  all children can be helped to identify their own ways of learning   metacognition   which will include strategies of planning    monitoring  evaluation  and choice of what to learn  Emotional awareness is   also part of metacognition  so children should be helped to be aware of their      feelings around the area to be learned  feelings of curiosity or confidence  for  example   i   High achievers have been found to use self regulatory learning strategies    more often and more effectively than lower achievers  and are better able to transfer these strategies to deal with unfamiliar tasks  This happens to such a high degree in some children that they appear to be demonstrating talent in particular areas  Overviewing research on the thinking process of highly able   wwwirLanguage com  " "X Test  children   Shore and Kanevsky    put the instructor s problem succinctly   if they  the gifted  merely think more quickly  then we eed only teach more quickly  If they merely make fewer errors  then we can shorten the practice   But  of course  this is ot entirely the case  adjustments have to be made in methods  of learning and teaching  to take account of the many ways individuals think  i D  Yet in order to learn by themselves  the gifted do eed some support from their  teachers  Conversely  teachers who have a tendency to  overdirect  can diminish   their gifted pupils  learning autonomy  Although  spoon feeding  can produce   extremely high examination results  these are ot always followed by equally     impressive life successes  Too much dependence on the teacher risks loss of i autonomy and motivation to discover  However  when teachers help pupilsto i reflect on their own learning and thinking activities  they increase their pupils     self regulation  For a young child  it may be just the simple question  What have    you learned today   which helps them to recognise what they are doing  Given    that a fundamental goal of education is to transfer the control of learning from teachers to pupils  improving pupils  learning to learn techniques shouldbe a    major outcome of the school experience  especially for the highly competent    There ate quite a umber of ew methods which can help  such as child  i  initiated learning  ability peer tutoring  etc  Such practices have been foundto    be particularly useful for bright children from deprived areas    FE Butscientific progress is ot all theoretical  knowledge is also vital to i   outstanding performance  individuals who know a great deal about a specific     domain will achieve at a higher level than those who do ot  Elshout     Research with creative scientists by Simonton    brought him to the   conclusion that above a certain high level  characteristics such as independence   seemed to contribute more to reaching the highest levels of expertise than   intellectual skills  due to the great demands of effort and time eeded for  learning and practice  Creativity in all forms can be seen as expertise mixed   with a high level of motivation  Weisberg      EF Tosumup  learning is affected by emotions of both the individual and i   significant others  Positive emotions facilitate the creative aspects of learning   and egative emotions inhibit it  Fear  for example  can limit the development   of curiosity  which is a strong force in scientific advance  because it motivates   problem solving behaviour  In Boekaerts     review of emotion in the   i learning of very high IQ and highly achieving children  she found emotional   forces in harness  They were ot only curious  but often had a strong desire to   control their environment  improve their learning efficiency  and increase their own leaning resources   wun

fact that people go to the Louvre museum in jj  hors k Paris to see the original painting Mona Lisa when   they can see a reproduction anywhere leads us   to question some assumptions about the role of museums of fine art in today s world One of the most famous works of art in content to assign the world is Leonardo da Vincis Mona the reproduction Lisa  Nearly everyone who goes to see the of their creations original will already be familiar with it from to their workshop reproductions  but they accept that fine art apprentices as  is more rewardingly viewed in its original regular  bread

techniques that allow go to a museum to read the writer s the production of high quality prints made actual manuscript rather than printed exactly to the original scale  with faithful reproduction  This might be explained by colour values  and even with duplication of the fact that the ovel has evolved precisely the surface relief of the painting  because of technological developments But despite an implicit recognition that that made it possible to print out huge the spread of good reproductions can be numbers of texts  whereas oil paintings have culturally valuable  museums continue

museum s function  since nothing the viewer thinks about the work the approach is dedicated to seeking out and is going to alter that value  and so today s  conserving  authentic    original  readings of viewer is deterred from trying to extend that the exhibits  Again  this seems to put paid spontaneous  immediate  self reliant kind of to that spontaneous  participatory criticism reading which would originally have met the which can be found in abundance in work  criticism of classic works of literature  but is The visitor may then be struck by the absent from most art history  strangeness of seeing such diverse paintings  The displays of art museums serve drawings and sculptures brought together as a warning of what critical practices in an environment for which they were ot can emerge when spontaneous criticism originally created  This  displacement effect   is suppressed  The museum public  like is further heightened by the sheer volume of any other audience  experience art more

of Tourism  A  Travel has existed since the beginning of time  when primitive man set out  often traversing great distances in search of game  which provided the food and clothing necessary for his survival  Throughout the course of history  people have travelled for purposes of trade  religious conviction  economic gain  war  migration and other equally compelling motivations  In the Roman era  wealthy aristocrats and high government officials also travelled for pleasure  Seaside resorts located at Pompeii and Herculaneum afforded citizens the opportunity to escape to their vacation villas in order to avoid the summer heat of Rome  Travel  except during the Dark Ages  has continued to grow and  throughout recorded history  has played a vital role in the development of civilisations and their economies   B Tourism in the mass form as we know it today is a distinctly twentieth century phenomenon  Historians suggest that the advent of mass tourism began in England during the industrial revolution with the rise of the middle class and the availability of relatively inexpensive transportation  The creation of the commercial airline industry following the Second World War and the subsequent development of the jet aircraft in the s signalled the rapid growth and expansion of international    travel  This growth led to the development of a major ew industry  tourism  In turn  international tourism became the concern of a umber of world governments since it ot only provided ew employment opportunities but also produced a means of earning foreign exchange   C Tourism today has grown significantly in both economic and social importance  In most industrialised countries over the past few years the fastest growth has been seen in the area of services  One of the largest segments of the service industry  although largely unrecognised as an entity in some of these countries  is travel and tourism  According to the World Travel and Tourism Council      Travel and tourism is the largest industry in the world on virtually any economic measure including value added capital investment  employment and tax contributions   In   the industry s gross output was estimated to be    trillion  over  per cent of all consumer spending  The travel and tourism industry is the world s largest employer with almost  million jobs  or almost  per cent of all employees  This industry is the world s leading industrial contributor  producing over  per cent of the world s gross ational product and accounting for capital investment in excess of   billion in direct  indirect and personal taxes each year  Thus  tourism has a profound impact both on the world economy and  because of the educative effect of travel and the effects on employment  on society itself     " "X Test   D However  the major problems of the travel and tourism industry that have hidden  or obscured  its economic impact are the diversity and fragmentation of the industry itself  The travel industry includes  hotels  motels and other types of accommodation  restaurants and other food services  transportation services and facilities  amusements  attractions and other leisure facilities  gift shops and a large umber of other enterprises  Since many of these businesses also serve local residents  the impact of spending by visitors can easily be overlooked or underestimated  In addition  Meis    points out that the tourism industry involves concepts that have remained amorphous to both analysts and decision makers  Moreover  in all ations this problem has made it difficult for the industry to develop any type of reliable or credible tourism information base in order to estimate the contribution it makes to regional  ational and global economies  However  the ature of this very diversity makes travel and tourism ideal vehicles for economic development in a wide variety of countries  regions or communities   E Once the exclusive province of the wealthy  travel and tourism have become an institutionalised way of life for most of the population  In fact  McIntosh and Goeldner    suggest that tourism has become the largest commodity in international trade for many ations and  for a significant umber of other countries  it ranks second or third  For example  tourism is the major source of income in Bermuda  Greece  Italy  Spain  Switzerland and most Caribbean countries  In addition  Hawkins and Ritchie  quoting from data published by the American  Express Company  suggest that the travel and tourism industry is the umber one ranked employer in the Bahamas  Brazil  Canada  France   the former  West Germany  Hong Kong  Italy  Jamaica  Japan  Singapore  the United Kingdom and the United States  However  because of problems of definition  which directly affect statistical measurement  itis ot possible with any degree of certainty to provide precise  valid or reliable data about the extent of world wide tourism participation or its economic impact  In many cases  similar difficulties arise when attempts are made to measure domestic tourism     wwwirLanguage com  " "X Reading Questions   Do the following statements agree with the information given in

are based on Reading  Passage  below   Autumn leaves Canadian writer Jay Ingram investigates the mystery of why leaves turn red in the fall  A One of the most captivating atural events of the year in many areas throughout North America is the turning of the leaves in the fall  The colours are magnificent  but the question of exactly why some trees turn yellow or orange  and others red or purple  is something which has long puzzled scientists   B Summer leaves are green because they are full of chlorophyll  the molecule that captures sunlight and converts that energy into ew building materials for the tree  As fall approaches in the orthern hemisphere  the amount of solar energy available declines considerably  For many trees   evergreen conifers being an exception   the best strategy is to abandon photosynthesis   until the spring  So rather than maintaining the ow redundant leaves throughout the winter  the tree saves its precious resources and discards them  But before letting its leaves go  the tree dismantles their chlorophyll molecules and ships their valuable itrogen back into the twigs  As chlorophyll is depleted  other colours that have been dominated by it throughout the summer begin to be revealed  This unmasking explains the autumn colours of yellow and orange  but ot the brilliant reds and purples of trees such as  the maple or sumac   C The source of the red is widely known  itis created by anthocyanins  water soluble plant pigments reflecting the red to blue range of the visible spectrum  They belong to aclass of sugar based chemical compounds also known as flavonoids  What s puzzling is that anthocyanins are actually ewly minted  made in the leaves at the same time as the tree is preparing to drop them  But it is hard to make sense of the manufacture of anthocyanins   why should a tree bother making ew chemicals in its leaves when it s  already scrambling to withdraw and preserve the ones already there   D  Some theories about anthocyanins have argued that they might act as a chemical defence against attacks by insects or fungi  or that they might attract fruit eating birds or increase a leaf s tolerance to freezing  However there are problems with each of these theories  including the fact that leaves are red for such a relatively short period that the expense of energy eeded to manufacture the anthocyanins would outweigh any anti fungal or anti herbivore activity achieved     photosynthesis  the production of ew material from sunlight  water and carbon dioxide    wwwirLanguage com  " "X Reading E Ithas also been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince herbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able to mount chemical defences against infestation  If insects paid attention to such advertisements  they might be prompted to lay their eggs on a duller  and presumably less resistant host  The flaw in this theory lies in the lack of proof to support it  No one has as yet ascertained whether more robust trees sport the brightest leaves  or whether insects make choices according to colour intensity  F  Perhaps the most plausible suggestion as to why leaves would go to the trouble of making anthocyanins when they re busy packing up for the winter is the theory known as the  light screen  hypothesis  It sounds paradoxical  because the idea behind this hypothesis is that the red pigment is made in autumn leaves to protect chlorophyll  the light absorbing chemical  from too much light  Why does chlorophyll eed protection when it is the atural world s supreme light absorber  Why protect chlorophyll at a time when the tree is breaking it down to salvage as much of it as possible  G Chlorophyll  although exquisitely evolved to capture the energy of sunlight  can sometimes be overwhelmed by it  especially in situations of drought  low temperatures  or utrient deficiency  Moreover  the problem of oversensitivity to light is even more acute in the fall  when the leaf is busy preparing for winter by dismantling its internal machinery  The energy absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules of the unstable autumn leaf is ot immediately channelled into useful products and processes  as it would be in an intact summer leaf  The weakened fall leaf then becomes vulnerable to the highly destructive effects of the oxygen created by the excited chlorophyll molecules  H  Even if you had ever suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn red  there are clues out there  One is straightforward  on many trees  the leaves that are the reddest are those on the side of the tree which gets most sun  Not only that  but the red is brighter on the upper side of the leaf  It has also been recognised for decades that the best conditions for intense red colours are dry  sunny days and cool nights  conditions that icely match those that make leaves susceptible to excess light  And finally  trees such as maples usually get much redder the more orth you travel in the orthem hemisphere  It s colder there  they re more stressed  their chlorophyll is more sensitive and it eeds more sunblock    What is still ot fully understood  however  is why some trees resort to producing red pigments while others don t bother  and simply reveal their orange or yellow hues  Do these trees have other means at their disposal to prevent overexposure to light in autumn  Their story  though ot as spectacular to the eye  will surely turn out to be as subtle and as complex   ww irLanguage com  " "X Test  Questions   Reading Passage  has ine paragraphs  A I  Which paragraph

meaningful way and that the key traits of personality are determined at a very young age  However  researchers have begun looking more closely at ways we can change  Positive psychologists have identified  qualities we admire  such as loyalty and kindness  and are studying them to find out why they come so aturally to some people  What they re discovering is that many of these qualities amount to habitual behaviour that determines the way we respond to the world  The good ews is that all this can be learned   Some qualities are less challenging to develop than others  optimism being one of them  However  developing qualities requires mastering a range of skills which are diverse and sometimes surprising  For example  to bring more joy and passion into your life  you must be open to experiencing egative emotions  Cultivating such qualities will help you realise your full potential  B  The evidence is good that most personality traits can be altered   says Christopher Peterson  professor of psychology at the University of Michigan  who cites himself as an example  Inherently introverted  he realised early on that as an academic  his reticence would prove disastrous in the lecture hall  So he learned to be more outgoing and to entertain his classes   Now my extroverted behaviour is spontaneous   he says     David Fajgenbaum had to make a similar transition  He was preparing for university  when he had an accident that put an end to his sports career  On campus  he quickly found that beyond ordinary counselling  the university had o services for students who were undergoing physical rehabilitation and suffering from depression like him  He therefore launched a support group to help others in similar situations  He took action despite his own pain   a typical response of an optimist   D Suzanne Segerstrom  professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky  believes that the key to increasing optimism is through cultivating optimistic behaviour  rather than positive thinking  She recommends you train yourself to pay attention to good fortune by writing down three positive things that come about each day  This will help you convince yourself that favourable outcomes actually happen all the time  making it easier to begin taking action     www irLanguage com  " "X Reading  E You ean recognise a person who is passionate about a pursuit by the way they are so strongly involved in it  Tanya Streeter s passion is freediving   the sport of plunging deep into the water without tanks or other breathing equipment  Beginning in   she set ine world records and can hold her breath for six minutes  The physical stamina required for this sport is intense but the psychological demands are even more overwhelming  Streeter learned to untangle her fears from her judgment of what her body and mind could do   In my career as a competitive freediver  there was a limit to what I could do  but it wasn t anywhere ear what I thought it was   she says   F  Finding a pursuit that excites you can improve anyone s life  The secret about consuming passions  though  according to psychologist Paul Silvia of the University of North Carolina  is that  they require discipline  hard work and ability  which is why they are so rewarding   Psychologist Todd Kashdan has this advice for those people taking up a ew passion   As a ewcomer  you also have to tolerate and laugh at your own ignorance  You must be willing to accept the egative feelings that come your way   he says   G In   physician scientist Mauro Zappaterra began his PhD research at Harvard Medical School  Unfortunately  he was miserable as his research wasn t compatible with his curiosity about healing  He finally took a break and during eight months in Santa Fe  Zappaterra learned about alternative healing techniques ot taught at Harvard  When he got back  he switched labs to study how cerebrospinal fluid nourishes the developing ervous system  He also vowed to look for the joy in everything  including failure  as this could help him learn about his research and himself    One thing that can hold joy back is a person s concentration on avoiding failure rather than their looking forward to doing something well   Focusing on being safe might get in the way of your reaching your goals  explains Kashdan  For example  are you hoping to get through a business lunch without embarrassing yourself  or    are you thinking about how fascinating the conversation might be   H Usually  we think of courage in physical terms but ordinary life demands something else  For marketing executive Kenneth Pedeleose  it meant speaking  out against something he thought was ethically wrong  The ew manager was  intimidating staff so Pedeleose carefully recorded each instance of bullying and eventually took the evidence to a senior director  knowing his own job security would be threatened  Eventually the manager was the one to go  According to Cynthia Pury  a psychologist at Clemson University  Pedeleose s story proves the point that courage is ot motivated by fearlessness  but by moral obligation  Pury also believes that people can acquire courage  Many of her students said that faced with a risky situation  they first tried to calm themselves down  then looked for a way to mitigate the danger  just as Pedeleose did by documenting his allegations  Over the long term  picking up a ew character trait may help you move toward being the person you want to be  And in the short term  the effort itself could be surprisingly rewarding  a kind of internal adventure

EUROPEAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
-
What have been the trends and what are the prospects for
European transport systems?

A Its difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport
system  Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical
transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport
continues to increase  There are two key factors behind this trend  For passenger
transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use  The number
of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year
from  to , and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial
increase in its fleet 

B As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in
the European economy and its system of production  In the last  years, as internal
frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a �stock� economy to a �flaw�
economy  This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries,
particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though
the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final
assembly plant or away from users 

� The strong economic growth expected in countries which are candidates for entry to
the EU will also increase transport fiows, in particular road haulage traffic  In ,
some of these countries already exported more than twice their  volumes and
imported more than five times their  volumes  And although many candidate
countries inherited a transport system which encourages rail, the distribution between
modes has tipped sharply in favour of road transport since the s  Between
 and , road haulage increased by  %, while during the same period rail
haulage decreased by  %, although � and this could benefit the enlarged EU - itis
still on average at a much higher level than in existing member states 

D However, a new imperative - sustainable development ~ offers an opportunity for
adapting the EU's common transport policy  This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg
European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations
into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at
the heart of its strategy  The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by ,

transport system which will ideally be in place in  years� time, that is by

E In , energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for % of
emissions of C, the leading greenhouse gas  According to the latest estimates, if
nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend, CO emissions from transport can
be expected to increase by around % to , billion tonnes by , compared
with the  billion tonnes recorded in   Once again, road transport is the main
culprit since it alone accounts for % of the CO emissions attributable to transport 
Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological
necessity and a technological challenge 

F At the same time greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift  Such 
change cannot be achieved overnight, all the less so after aver half a century of
constant deterioration in favour of road  This has reached such a pitch that today rail
freight services are facing marginalisation, with just % of market share, and with
international goods trains struggling along at an average speed of km/h  Three
possible options have emerged 

G The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing 
This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes
of transport  In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through
the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles
expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport  However, the lack of
measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for
more sustainable mades of transport to take up the baton 

H The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied
by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services,
logistics, technology)  However, this approach does not include investment in new
infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regionel cohesion  It could help to achieve
greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion's
share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being
the most polluting of the modes  It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary
shift of the balance 

I The third approach, which is not new, comprises a series of measures ranging from
pricing to revitalising alternative modes of transport and targeting investment in the
trans-European network  This integrated approach would allaw the market: shares of
the other mades to return to their  levels and thus make a shift of balance  It is
far more ambitious than it looks, bearing in mind the historical imbalance in favour of
roads for the last fifty years, but would achieve a marked break in the link between road
transport growth and economic growth, without placing restrictions on the mobility of
people and goods

Tea and the Industrial Revolution
A Cambridge professor says that a change in drinking habits was the reason for
the Industrial Revolution in Britain  Anjana Abuja reports

A Alan Macfarlane, professor of anthropological science at King�s College, Cambridge, has, like
other historians, spent decades wrestling with the enigma of the Industrial Revolution  Why 
did this particular Big Bang - the world-changing birth of industry � happen in Britain? And
why did it strike at the end of the th century?

B Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock  �There are about  different
factors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen,� he says  For
industry to take off, there needs to be the technology and power to drive factories, large
urban populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an
affluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produced objects, a market-driven economy and
a political system that allows this to happen  While this was the case for England, other
nations, such as Japan, the Netherlands and France also met some of these criteria but were
not industrialising  �All these factors must have been necessary but not sufficient to cause the
revolution,� says Macfarlane  �After all, Holland had everything except coal, while China also
had many of these factors  Most historians are convinced there are one or two missing factors
that you need to open the lock �

� The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in almost every kitchen cupboard  Tea and
beer, cwo of the nation�s favourite drinks, fuelled the revolution  The antiseptic properties
of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer � plus the fact that both are
made with boiled water � allowed urban communities to fourish at close quarters without
succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery  The theory sounds eccentric but once
he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction, the scepticism gives
�way to wary admiration  Macfarlane�s case has been strengthened by support from notable
quarters � Roy Porter, the distinguished medical historian, recently wrote a favourable
appraisal of his research 

D Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about 
Historians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid-th century that required
explanation, Between about  and , the population in Britain was static  But then
there was a burst in population growth  Macfarlane says: �The infant mortality rate halved
in the space of  years, and this happened in both rural areas and cities, and across all
classes  People suggested four possible causes  Was there a sudden change in the viruses and
bacteria around? Unlikely  Was there a revolution in medical science? But this was a century,
before Lister's revolution*  Was there a change in environmental conditions? There were
improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small gains  Sanitation
did not become widespread until the th century  The only option left is food  Bur the
height and weight statistics show a decline  So the food must have got worse  Efforts to
explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank �

�eh eco dover te a hg ng sg opens opinion



vw itanguage-com
" "Reading

E This population burst seemed to happen at just the right time co provide labour for the
Industrial Revolution  �When you start moving towards an industrial revolution, it is
economically efficient ro have people living close together, says Macfarlane  �But then you
get disease, particularly from human waste � Some digging around in historical records
revealed that there was a change in the incidence of water-borne disease at that time,
�specially dysentery  Macfarlane deduced that whatever the British were drinking must have
been important in regulating disease  He says, �We drank beet  For a long time, the English
were protected by the strong antibacterial agent in hops, which were added to help preserve
the beer  But in the late th century a tax was introduced on malt, the basic ingredient of
beer  The poor turned to water and gin and in the s the mortality rate began to rise
again  Then it suddenly dropped again  What caused this?�

F Macfarlane looked to Japan, which was also developing large cities about the same time,
and also had no sanitation  Water-borne diseases had a much looser grip on the Japanese
population than those in Britain  Could it be the prevalence of tea in their culeure?
Macfarlane then noted that the history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary
coincidence of dates  Tea was relatively expensive until Britain started a direct clipper trade
with China in che early th century  By the s, about the time chat infant mortality
was dipping, the drink was common  Macfarlane guessed that the fact that water had to
be boiled, rogether with the stomach-purifying properties of tea meant that the breast
milk provided by mothers was healthier than it had ever been, No other European nation
sipped tea like the British, which, by Macfarlane� logic, pushed these other countries out of
contention for the revolution 

G Bus, iftea isa factor in the combination lock, why didn�t Japan forge ahead in a cea-soaked
industrial revolution of its own? Macfarlane notes that even though th-century Japan had
large cities, high literacy rates, even a futures marker, it had turned its back on the essence
of any work-based revolution by giving up labour-saving devices such as animals, afraid that
they would put people out of work  So, the nation that we now think of as one of the most
technologically advanced entered the th century having �abandoned the whee!�

READING PASSAGE 

You should spend about  minutes on Questions -, which are based on

Reading Passage  below 

: Gifted children and learning

| A Internationally, �giftedness� is most frequently determined by a score ona

 general intelligence test, known as an IO test, which is above a chosen cut-

i off point, usually at around the top -%  Children�s educational environment

| contributes to the IQ score and the way intelligence is used  For example,

 a very close positive relationship was found when children�s IQ scores were i
compared with their home educational provision (Freeman, )  The higher
the children�s IO scores, especially over IQ , the better the quality of their
educational backup, measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with
parents, number of books and activities in their home etc  Because IQ tests are
decidedly influenced by what the child has learned, they are tosomeextent
measures of current achievement based on age-norms; that is, how wellthe
children have learned to manipulate their knowledge and know-how within the

 terms of the test  The vocabulary aspect, for example, is dependent on having |
heard those words  But IO tests can neither identify the processes of learning
and thinking nor predict creativity 

B  Excellence does not emerge without appropriate help  To reach an
exceptionally high standard in any area very able children need the means to
learn, which includes material to work with and focused challenging tuition
~and the encouragement to follow their dream  There appears to be a
qualitative difference in the way the intellectually highly able think, compared |
with more average-ability or older pupils, for whom external regulation by the i
teacher often compensates for lack of internal regulation  To be at their most!
effective in their self-regulation, all children can be helped to identify their own
ways of learning ~ metacognition � which will include strategies of planning, :
monitoring, evaluation, and choice of what to learn  Emotional awareness is

 also part of metacognition, so children should be helped to be aware of their |

| feelings around the area to be learned, feelings of curiosity or confidence, for

example 

i � High achievers have been found to use self-regulatory learning strategies

| more often and more effectively than lower achievers, and are better able to
transfer these strategies to deal with unfamiliar tasks  This happens to such a
high degree in some children that they appear to be demonstrating talent in

children, (Shore and Kanevsky, ) put the instructor's problem succinctly:
�if they [the gifted] merely think more quickly, then we need only teach more
quickly  If they merely make fewer errors, then we can shorten the practice�  But:
of course, this is not entirely the case; adjustments have to be made in methods:
of learning and teaching, to take account of the many ways individuals think  i
D  Yet in order to learn by themselves, the gifted do need some support from their:
teachers  Conversely, teachers who have a tendency to �overdirect� can diminish :
their gifted pupils� learning autonomy  Although �spoon-feeding� can produce
: extremely high examination results, these are not always followed by equally =
| impressive life successes  Too much dependence on the teacher risks loss of
i autonomy and motivation to discover  However, when teachers help pupilsto i
reflect on their own learning and thinking activities, they increase their pupils�!
: self-regulation  For a young child, it may be just the simple question �What have :
 you learned today?� which helps them to recognise what they are doing  Given:
| that a fundamental goal of education is to transfer the control of learning from
teachers to pupils, improving pupils� learning to learn techniques shouldbe a=
| major outcome of the school experience, especially for the highly competent 
| There ate quite a number of new methods which can help, such as child- i
[initiated learning, ability-peer tutoring, etc  Such practices have been foundto :
 be particularly useful for bright children from deprived areas  :
FE Butscientific progress is not all theoretical, knowledge is also vital to i
} outstanding performance: individuals who know a great deal about a specific =
| domain will achieve at a higher level than those who do not (Elshout, ) 
Research with creative scientists by Simonton () brought him to the
� conclusion that above a certain high level, characteristics such as independence
| seemed to contribute more to reaching the highest levels of expertise than
| intellectual skills, due to the great demands of effort and time needed for
 learning and practice  Creativity in all forms can be seen as expertise mixed
| with a high level of motivation (Weisberg, )  
EF Tosumup, learning is affected by emotions of both the individual and i
| significant others  Positive emotions facilitate the creative aspects of learning
| and negative emotions inhibit it  Fear, for example, can limit the development
| of curiosity, which is a strong force in scientific advance, because it motivates
} problem-solving behaviour  In Boekaerts� () review of emotion in the :
i learning of very high IQ and highly achieving children, she found emotional
| forces in harness  They were not only curious, but often had a strong desire to

Museums of fine art and their public
The fact that people go to the Louvre museum in jj  hors k
Paris to see the original painting Mona Lisa when  
they can see a reproduction anywhere leads us ,
to question some assumptions about the role of
museums of fine art in today�s world
One of the most famous works of art in content to assign
the world is Leonardo da Vincis Mona the reproduction
Lisa  Nearly everyone who goes to see the of their creations
original will already be familiar with it from to their workshop
reproductions, but they accept that fine art apprentices as,
is more rewardingly viewed in its original regular �bread and butter� work  And
form  today the task of reproducing pictures is
However, if Mona Lisa was a famous incomparably more simple and reliable,
novel, few people would bother to with reprographic techniques that allow
go to a museum to read the writer's the production of high-quality prints made
actual manuscript rather than printed exactly to the original scale, with faithful
reproduction  This might be explained by colour values, and even with duplication of
the fact that the novel has evolved precisely the surface relief of the painting 
because of technological developments But despite an implicit recognition that
that made it possible to print out huge the spread of good reproductions can be
numbers of texts, whereas oil paintings have culturally valuable, museums continue to
always been produced as unique objects  In promote the special status of original work
addition, it could be argued that the practice Unfortunately, this seems to place severe

follows different conventions  With novels, to visitors 
the reader attends mainly to the meaning of One limitation is related to the way the
words rather than the way they are printed museum presents its exhibits  As repositories
on the page, whereas the �reader� of a of unique historical objects, art museums
painting must attend just as closely to the are often called �treasure houses�  We are
material form of marks and shapes in the reminded of this even before we view

Yet it has always been possible to make guards, attendants, ropes and display cases
very accurate facsimiles of pretty well any to keep us away from the exhibits  In many

National Gallery is housed in numerous the audience encounters an opera or a play
rooms, each with dozens of works, any over a specific time, which is the duration
one of which is likely to be worth more of the performance  Similarly, novels and
than all the average visitor possesses  Ina poems are read in a prescribed temporal
society that judges the personal status of the sequence, whereas a picture has no clear
individual so much by their material worth, place at which to start viewing, or at
it is therefore difficult not to be impressed by which to finish  Thus art works themselves

The visitor may then be struck by the absent from most art history

The Context, Meaning
and Scope of Tourism

A  Travel has existed since the beginning of time, when primitive man set out, often
traversing great distances in search of game, which provided the food and clothing
necessary for his survival  Throughout the course of history, people have travelled
for purposes of trade, religious conviction, economic gain, war, migration and other
equally compelling motivations  In the Roman era, wealthy aristocrats and high
government officials also travelled for pleasure  Seaside resorts located at Pompeii
and Herculaneum afforded citizens the opportunity to escape to their vacation villas
in order to avoid the summer heat of Rome  Travel, except during the Dark Ages,
has continued to grow and, throughout recorded history, has played a vital role in the
development of civilisations and their economies 

B Tourism in the mass form as we know it today is a distinctly twentieth-century
phenomenon  Historians suggest that the advent of mass tourism began in England
during the industrial revolution with the rise of the middle class and the availability
of relatively inexpensive transportation  The creation of the commercial airline
industry following the Second World War and the subsequent development of the
jet aircraft in the s signalled the rapid growth and expansion of international

| travel  This growth led to the development of a major new industry: tourism  In turn,
international tourism became the concern of a number of world governments since
it not only provided new employment opportunities but also produced a means of
earning foreign exchange 

C Tourism today has grown significantly in both economic and social importance  In
most industrialised countries over the past few years the fastest growth has been
seen in the area of services  One of the largest segments of the service industry,
although largely unrecognised as an entity in some of these countries, is travel
and tourism  According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (), �Travel
and tourism is the largest industry in the world on virtually any economic measure
including value-added capital investment, employment and tax contributions�  In
, the industry's gross output was estimated to be $  trillion, over  per cent
of all consumer spending  The travel and tourism industry is the world�s largest
employer with almost  million jobs, or almost  per cent of all employees  This
industry is the world�s leading industrial contributor, producing over  per cent of
the world�s gross national product and accounting for capital investment in excess
of $ billion in direct, indirect and personal taxes each year  Thus, tourism has a
profound impact both on the world economy and, because of the educative effect of
travel and the effects on employment, on society itself 


" "Test 

D However, the major problems of the travel and tourism industry that have hidden,
or obscured, its economic impact are the diversity and fragmentation of the
industry itself  The travel industry includes: hotels, motels and other types of
accommodation; restaurants and other food services; transportation services and
facilities; amusements, attractions and other leisure facilities; gift shops and a
large number of other enterprises  Since many of these businesses also serve
local residents, the impact of spending by visitors can easily be overlooked or
underestimated  In addition, Meis () points out that the tourism industry
involves concepts that have remained amorphous to both analysts and decision
makers  Moreover, in all nations this problem has made it difficult for the industry
to develop any type of reliable or credible tourism information base in order to
estimate the contribution it makes to regional, national and global economies 
However, the nature of this very diversity makes travel and tourism ideal vehicles
for economic development in a wide variety of countries, regions or communities 

E Once the exclusive province of the wealthy, travel and tourism have become an
institutionalised way of life for most of the population  In fact, McIntosh and
Goeldner () suggest that tourism has become the largest commodity in
international trade for many nations and, for a significant number of other countries,
it ranks second or third  For example, tourism is the major source of income in
Bermuda, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and most Caribbean countries  In
addition, Hawkins and Ritchie, quoting from data published by the American,
Express Company, suggest that the travel and tourism industry is the number
one ranked employer in the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, France, (the former) West
Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and
the United States  However, because of problems of definition, which directly affect
statistical measurement, itis not possible with any degree of certainty to provide
precise, valid or reliable data about the extent of world-wide tourism participation
or its economic impact  In many cases, similar difficulties arise when attempts are
made to measure domestic tourism

Passage  below 

Autumn leaves
Canadian writer Jay Ingram investigates the
mystery of why leaves turn red in the fall

A One of the most captivating natural events of the year in many areas throughout
North America is the turning of the leaves in the fall  The colours are magnificent,
but the question of exactly why some trees turn yellow or orange, and others red or
purple, is something which has long puzzled scientists 

B Summer leaves are green because they are full of chlorophyll, the molecule that
captures sunlight and converts that energy into new building materials for the tree 
As fall approaches in the northern hemisphere, the amount of solar energy available
declines considerably  For many trees - evergreen conifers being an exception �
the best strategy is to abandon photosynthesis\" until the spring  So rather than
maintaining the now redundant leaves throughout the winter, the tree saves its
precious resources and discards them  But before letting its leaves go, the tree
dismantles their chlorophyll molecules and ships their valuable nitrogen back into
the twigs  As chlorophyll is depleted, other colours that have been dominated by it
throughout the summer begin to be revealed  This unmasking explains the autumn
colours of yellow and orange, but not the brilliant reds and purples of trees such as
�the maple or sumac 

C The source of the red is widely known: itis created by anthocyanins, water-soluble
plant pigments reflecting the red to blue range of the visible spectrum  They belong to
aclass of sugar-based chemical compounds also known as flavonoids  What's puzzling
is that anthocyanins are actually newly minted, made in the leaves at the same time as
the tree is preparing to drop them  But it is hard to make sense of the manufacture of
anthocyanins - why should a tree bother making new chemicals in its leaves when it's,
already scrambling to withdraw and preserve the ones already there?

D  Some theories about anthocyanins have argued that they might act as a chemical
defence against attacks by insects or fungi, or that they might attract fruit-eating
birds or increase a leaf�s tolerance to freezing  However there are problems with
each of these theories, including the fact that leaves are red for such a relatively
short period that the expense of energy needed to manufacture the anthocyanins
would outweigh any anti-fungal or anti-herbivore activity achieved 

* photosynthesis: the production of new material from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide



wwwirLanguage com
" "Reading
E Ithas also been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince
herbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able
to mount chemical defences against infestation  If insects paid attention to
such advertisements, they might be prompted to lay their eggs on a duller, and
presumably less resistant host  The flaw in this theory lies in the lack of proof
to support it  No one has as yet ascertained whether more robust trees sport the
brightest leaves, or whether insects make choices according to colour intensity 
F  Perhaps the most plausible suggestion as to why leaves would go to the trouble
of making anthocyanins when they're busy packing up for the winter is the
theory known as the �light screen� hypothesis  It sounds paradoxical, because the
idea behind this hypothesis is that the red pigment is made in autumn leaves to
protect chlorophyll, the light-absorbing chemical, from too much light  Why does
chlorophyll need protection when it is the natural world�s supreme light absorber?
Why protect chlorophyll at a time when the tree is breaking it down to salvage as
much of it as possible?
G Chlorophyll, although exquisitely evolved to capture the energy of sunlight,
can sometimes be overwhelmed by it, especially in situations of drought, low
temperatures, or nutrient deficiency  Moreover, the problem of oversensitivity
to light is even more acute in the fall, when the leaf is busy preparing for winter
by dismantling its internal machinery  The energy absorbed by the chlorophyll
molecules of the unstable autumn leaf is not immediately channelled into useful
products and processes, as it would be in an intact summer leaf  The weakened fall
leaf then becomes vulnerable to the highly destructive effects of the oxygen created
by the excited chlorophyll molecules 
H  Even if you had never suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn
red, there are clues out there  One is straightforward: on many trees, the leaves that
are the reddest are those on the side of the tree which gets most sun  Not only that,
but the red is brighter on the upper side of the leaf  It has also been recognised for
decades that the best conditions for intense red colours are dry, sunny days and cool
nights, conditions that nicely match those that make leaves susceptible to excess
light  And finally, trees such as maples usually get much redder the more north you
travel in the northem hemisphere  It's colder there, they're more stressed, their
chlorophyll is more sensitive and it needs more sunblock 
| What is still not fully understood, however, is why some trees resort to producing
red pigments while others don't bother, and simply reveal their orange or yellow
hues  Do these trees have other means at their disposal to prevent overexposure to
light in autumn? Their story, though not as spectacular to the eye, will surely turn
out to be as subtle and as complex

Passage  below 

Second nature

Your personality isn't necessarily set in stone  With a little experimentation,

people can reshape their temperaments and inject passion, optimism, joy and

courage into their lives

A  Psychologists have long held that a person's character cannot undergo a
transformation in any meaningful way and that the key traits of personality are
determined at a very young age  However, researchers have begun looking more
closely at ways we can change  Positive psychologists have identified  qualities
we admire, such as loyalty and kindness, and are studying them to find out why
they come so naturally to some people  What they're discovering is that many of
these qualities amount to habitual behaviour that determines the way we respond
to the world  The good news is that all this can be learned 

Some qualities are less challenging to develop than others, optimism being one of
them  However, developing qualities requires mastering a range of skills which are
diverse and sometimes surprising  For example, to bring more joy and passion into
your life, you must be open to experiencing negative emotions  Cultivating such
qualities will help you realise your full potential

B �The evidence is good that most personality traits can be altered,� says Christopher
Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, who cites himself
as an example  Inherently introverted, he realised early on that as an academic,
his reticence would prove disastrous in the lecture hall  So he learned to be
more outgoing and to entertain his classes  �Now my extroverted behaviour is
spontaneous,� he says 

� David Fajgenbaum had to make a similar transition  He was preparing for
university, when he had an accident that put an end to his sports career  On
campus, he quickly found that beyond ordinary counselling, the university had no
services for students who were undergoing physical rehabilitation and suffering
from depression like him  He therefore launched a support group to help others in
similar situations  He took action despite his own pain ~ a typical response of an
optimist 

D Suzanne Segerstrom, professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky,
believes that the key to increasing optimism is through cultivating optimistic
behaviour, rather than positive thinking  She recommends you train yourself to pay
attention to good fortune by writing down three positive things that come about
each day  This will help you convince yourself that favourable outcomes actually
happen all the time, making it easier to begin taking action

E You ean recognise a person who is passionate about a pursuit by the way they
are so strongly involved in it  Tanya Streeter�s passion is freediving - the sport
of plunging deep into the water without tanks or other breathing equipment 
Beginning in , she set nine world records and can hold her breath for
six minutes  The physical stamina required for this sport is intense but the
psychological demands are even more overwhelming  Streeter learned to untangle
her fears from her judgment of what her body and mind could do  �In my career
as a competitive freediver, there was a limit to what I could do� but it wasn�t
anywhere near what I thought it was,� she says 

F  Finding a pursuit that excites you can improve anyone's life  The secret about
consuming passions, though, according to psychologist Paul Silvia of the
University of North Carolina, is that �they require discipline, hard work and ability,
which is why they are so rewarding,� Psychologist Todd Kashdan has this advice
for those people taking up a new passion: �As a newcomer, you also have to tolerate
and laugh at your own ignorance  You must be willing to accept the negative
feelings that come your way,� he says 

G In , physician-scientist Mauro Zappaterra began his PhD research at Harvard
Medical School  Unfortunately, he was miserable as his research wasn�t compatible
with his curiosity about healing  He finally took a break and during eight months
in Santa Fe, Zappaterra learned about alternative healing techniques not taught
at Harvard  When he got back, he switched labs to study how cerebrospinal fluid
nourishes the developing nervous system  He also vowed to look for the joy in
everything, including failure, as this could help him learn about his research and
himself 

�One thing that can hold joy back is a person�s concentration on avoiding failure
rather than their looking forward to doing something well  �Focusing on being safe
might get in the way of your reaching your goals, explains Kashdan  For example,
are you hoping to get through a business lunch without embarrassing yourself, or

| are you thinking about how fascinating the conversation might be?

H Usually, we think of courage in physical terms but ordinary life demands
something else  For marketing executive Kenneth Pedeleose, it meant speaking,
out against something he thought was ethically wrong  The new manager was 
intimidating staff so Pedeleose carefully recorded each instance of bullying and
eventually took the evidence to a senior director, knowing his own job security
would be threatened  Eventually the manager was the one to go  According to
Cynthia Pury, a psychologist at Clemson University, Pedeleose�s story proves the
point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by moral obligation  Pury
also believes that people can acquire courage  Many of her students said that faced
with a risky situation, they first tried to calm themselves down, then looked for a
way to mitigate the danger, just as Pedeleose did by documenting his allegations 
Over the long term, picking up a new character trait may help you move toward
being the person you want to be  And in the short term, the effort itself could be
surprisingly rewarding, a kind of internal adventure

Evolution isn't supposed to run backwards � yet an increasing number

The description of any animal as an in terms of probability, stating that there is no

For the better part of a century, most its just very unlikely  And so the idea of
biologists have been reluctant to use those  irreversibility in evolution stuck and came to

that says �evolution cannot run backwards� 
But as more and more examples come to if Dollo�s law is right, atavisms should
