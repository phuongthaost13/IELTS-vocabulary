institution where any person can find instruction in any subject   That was the founder s motto for Cornell University  and it seems an apt characterization of the different university  also in the USA  where I currently teach philosophy  A student can prepare for a career in resort management  enginecring  interior design  accounting  music  law enforcement  you ame it  But what would the founders of these two institutions have thought of a course called  Arson for Profit  I kid you ot  we have it on the books  Any undergraduates who have met the academic requirements can sign up for the course in our program in  fire science    B Naturally  the course is intended for prospective arson investigators  who can learn all the tricks of the trade for detecting whether a fire was deliberately set  discovering who did it  and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law  But wouldn t this also be the perfect course for prospective arsonists to sign up for  My point is ot to criticize academic programs in fire science  they are highly welcome as part of the increasing professionalization of this and many other occupations  However  irs ot unknown for a firefighter to torch a building  This example suggests how dishonest and illegal behavior  with the help of higher education  can creep into every aspect of public and business life   C I realized this anew when   was invited to speak before a class in marketing  which is another of our degree programs  The regular instructor is a colleague who appreciates the kind of ethical perspective I can bring as a philosopher  There are endless ways I could have approached this assignment  but I took my cue from the title of the course   Principles of Marketing   It made me think to ask the students   Is marketing principled   After all  a subject matter can have principles in the sense of being codified  having rules  as with football or chess  without being principled in the sense of being ethical  Many of the students immediately assumed that the answer to my question about marketing principles was obvious  o  Just look at the ways in which everything under the sun has been marketed  obviously it eed ot be done in a principled   ethical  fashion   D Is that obvious  I made the suggestion  which may sound downright crazy in light of the evidence  that perhaps marketing is by definition principled  My inspiration for this judgement is the philosopher Immanuel Kant  who argued that any body of knowledge consists of an end  or purpose  and a means     " "X Reading  E Let us apply both the terms  means  and  end  to marketing  The students have signed up for a course in order to learn how to market effectively  But to what end  There seem to be two main attitudes toward that question  One is that the answer is obvious  the purpose of marketing is to sell things and to make money  The other attitude is that the purpose of marketing is irrelevant  Each person comes to the program and course with his or her own plans  and these eed ot even concern the acquisition of marketing expertise as such  My proposal  which I believe would also be Kant s  is that either of these attitudes captures the significance of the end to the means for marketing  A field of knowledge or a professional endeavor is defined by both the means and the end  hence both deserve scrutiny  Students eed to study both how to achieve X  and also what X is   F   Icis at this point that  Arson for Profit  becomes supremely relevant  That course is presumably all about means  how to detect and prosecute criminal activity  It is therefore assumed that the end is good in an ethical sense  When I ask fire science students to articulate the end  or purpose  of their field  they eventually generalize to something like   The safety and welfare of society  which seems right  As we have seen  someone could use the very same knowledge of means to achieve a much less oble end  such as personal profit via destructive  dangerous  reckless activity  But we would ot call that firefighting  We have a separate word for it  azson  Similarly  if you employed the  principles of marketing  in an unprincipled way  you would ot be doing marketing  We have another term for it  fraud  Kant gives the example of a doctor and a poisoner  who use the identical knowledge to achieve their divergent ends  We would say that one is practicing medicine  the other  murder       " "X Test  Questions   Complete the summary below  Choose NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage for each

faces in developing countries Synthesis of an online debate   A Two things distinguish food production from all other productive activities  first  every single person eeds food each day and has a right to it  and second  it is hugely dependent on ature  These two unique aspects  one political  the other natural  make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other business  At the same time  cultural values are highly entrenched in food and agricultural systems worldwide   B Farmers everywhere face major risks  including extreme weather  long term climate change  and price volatility in input and product markets  However  smallholder farmers in developing countries must in addition deal with adverse environments  both atural  in terms of soil quality  rainfall  etc   and human  in terms of infrastructure  financial systems  markets  knowledge and technology  Counter intuitively  hunger is prevalent among many smallholder farmers in the developing world   C Participants in the online debate argued that our biggest challenge is to address the underlying causes of the agricultural system s inability to ensure sufficient food for all  and they identified as drivers of this problem our dependency on fossil fuels and unsupportive government policies   D On the question of mitigating the risks farmers face  most essayists called for greater state intervention  In his essay  Kanayo F  Nwanze  President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development  argued that governments can significantly reduce risks for farmers by providing basic services like roads to get produce more efficiently to markets  or water and food storage facilities to reduce losses  Sophia Murphy  senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy  suggested that the procurement and holding of stocks by governments can also help mitigate wild swings in food prices by alleviating uncertainties about market supply    The personal ames in the text refer to the authors of written contributions to the online debate     " "X Reading  E  Shenggen Fan  Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute  held up social safety ets and public welfare programmes in Ethiopia  Brazil and Mexico as valuable ways to address poverty among farming families and reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks  However  some commentators responded that cash transfers to poor families do ot ecessarily translate into increased food security  as these programmes do ot always strengthen food production or raise incomes  Regarding state subsidies for agriculture  Rokeya Kabir  Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha  commented in her essay that these  have ot compensated for the stranglehold exercised by private traders  In fact  studies show that sixty percent of beneficiaries of subsidies are ot poor  but rich landowners and on farmer traders    F  Nwanze  Murphy and Fan argued that private risk management tools  like private insurance  commodity futures markets  and rural finance can help small scale producers mitigate risk and allow for investment in improvements  Kabir warned that financial support schemes often encourage the adoption of high input agricultural practices  which in the medium term may raise production costs beyond the value of their harvests  Murphy oted that when futures markets become excessively financialised they can contribute to short term price volatility  which increases farmers  food insecurity  Many participants and commentators emphasised that greater transparency in markets is eeded to mitigate the impact of volatility  and make evident whether adequate stocks and supplies are available  Others contended that agribusiness companies should be held responsible for paying for egative side effects   G Many essayists mentioned climate change and its consequences for small scale agriculture  Fan explained that  in addition to reducing crop yields  climate change increases the magnitude and the frequency of extreme weather events  which increase smallholder vulnerability   The growing unpredictability of weather patterns increases farmers  difficulty in managing weather related risks  According to this author  one solution would be to develop crop varieties that are more resilient to ew climate trends and extreme weather patterns  Accordingly  Pat Mooney  co founder and executive director of the ETC Group  suggested that  if we are to survive climate change  we must adopt policies that let peasants diversify the plant and animal species and varieties breeds that make up our menus      " "X Test   H   Some participating authors and commentators argued in favour of community  based and autonomous risk management strategies through collective action groups  co operatives or producers  groups  Such groups enhance market opportunities for small scale producers  reduce marketing costs and synchronise buying and selling with seasonal price conditions  According to Murphy   collective action offers an important way for farmers to strengthen their political and economic bargaining power  and to reduce their business risks   One commentator  Giel Ton  warned that collective action does ot come as a free good  It takes time  effort and money to organise  build trust and to experiment  Others  like Marcel Vernooij and Marcel Beukeboom  suggested that in order to  apply what we already know   all stakeholders  including business  government  scientists and civil society  must work together  starting at the beginning of the value chain   I Some participants explained that market price volatility is often worsened by the presence of intermediary purchasers who  taking advantage of farmers  vulnerability  dictate prices  One commentator suggested farmers can gain greater control over prices and minimise price volatility by selling directly to consumers  Similarly  Sonali Bisht  founder and advisor to the Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research and Education  INHERE   India  wrote that community supported agriculture  where consumers invest in local farmers by subscription and guarantee producers a fair price  is a risk sharing model worth more attention  Direct food distribution systems not only encourage small scale agriculture but also give consumers more control over the food they consume

and academic Hiram Bingham arrived in South America in    he was ready for what was to be the greatest achievement of his life  the exploration of the remote hinterland to the west of Cusco  the old capital of the Inca empire in the Andes mountains of Peru  His goal was to locate the remains of a city called Vitcos  the last capital of the Inca civilisation  Cusco lies on a high plateau  at an elevation of more than   metres  and Bingham s plan was to descend from this plateau along the valley of the Urubamba river  which takes a circuitous route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons and mountain ranges   B When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba in late July  they had an advantage over travellers who had preceded them  a track had recently been blasted down the valley canyon to enable rubber to be brought up by mules from the jungle  Almost all previous travellers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the river lower down  thereby cutting a subsiantial corner  but also therefore ever passing through the area around Machu Picchu   C On  July they were a few days into their descent of the valley  The day began slowly  with Bingham trying to arrange sufficient mules for the ext stage of the trek  His companions showed o interest in accompanying him up the earby hill to see some ruins that a local farmer  Melchor Arteaga  had told them about the night before  The morning was dull and damp  and Bingham also seems to have been less than keen on the prospect of climbing the hill  In his book Lost City of the Incas  he relates that he made the ascent without having the least expectation that he would find anything at the top   D Bingham writes about the approach in vivid style in his book  First  as he climbs up the hill  he describes the ever present possibility of deadly snakes   capable of making considerable springs when in pursuit of their prey   ot that he sees any  Then there s a sense of mounting discovery as he comes across great sweeps of terraces  then a mausoleum  followed by monumental staircases and  finally  the grand ceremonial buildings of Machu Picchu   It seemed like an unbelievable dream     the sight held me spellbound      he wrote     " "X Test     We should remember  however  that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight  not written until   many years after his journey  His journal entries of the time reveal a much more gradual appreciation of his achievement  He spent the afternoon at the ruins oting down the dimensions of some of the buildings  then descended and rejoined his companions  to whom he seems to have said little about his discovery  At this stage  Bingham didn t realise the extent or the importance of the site  or did he realise what use he could make of the discovery   F However  soon after returning it occurred to him that he could make a ame for himself from this discovery  When he came to write the National Geographic magazine article that broke the story to the world in April   he knew he had to produce a big idea  He wondered whether it could have been the birthplace of the very first Inca  Manco the Great  and whether it could also have been what chroniclers described as  the last city of the Incas   This term refers to Vilcabamba  the settlement where the Incas had fled from Spanish invaders in the s  Bingham made desperate attempts to prove this belief for early  years  Sadly  his vision of the site as both the beginning and end of the Inca civilisation  while a magnificent one  is inaccurate  We ow know that Vilcabamba actually lies  kilometres away in the depths of the jungle   G One question that has perplexed visitors  historians and archaeologists alike ever since Bingham  is why the site seems to have been abandoned before the Spanish Conquest  There are o references to it by any of the Spanish chroniclers   and if they had known of its existence so close to Cusco they would certainly have come in search of gold  An idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past few years is that Machu Picchu was a moya  a country estate built by an Inca emperor to escape the cold winters of Cusco  where the elite could enjoy monumental architecture and spectacular views  Furthermore  the particular architecture of Machu Picchu suggests that it was constructed at the time of the greatest of all the Incas  the emperor Pachacuti  c      By custom  Pachacuti s descendants built other similar estates for their own use  and so Machu Picchu would have been abandoned after his death  some  years before the Spanish Conquest     " "X Reading Questions   Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage

Passage  below   The Benefits of Being Bilingual  A According to the latest figures  the majority of the world s population is ow bilingual or multilingual  having grown up speaking two or more languages  In the past  such children were considered to be at a disadvantage compared with their monolingual peers  Over the past few decades  however  technological advances have allowed researchers to look more deeply at how bilingualism interacts with and changes the cognitive and eurological systems  thereby identifying several clear benefits of being bilingual   B Research shows that when a bilingual person uses one language  the other is active at the same time  When we hear a word  we don t hear the entire word all at once  the sounds arrive in sequential order  Long before the word is finished  the brain s language system begins to guess what that word might be  If you hear  can   you will likely activate words like  candy  and  candle  as well  at least during the earlier stages of word recognition  For bilingual people  this activation is ot limited to a single language  auditory input activates corresponding words regardless of the language to which they belong  Some of the most compelling evidence for this phenomenon  called  language co activation   comes from studying eye movements  A Russian English bilingual asked to  pick up a marker  from a set of objects would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn t know Russian  because the Russian word for  stamp   marka  sounds like the English word he or she heard   marker   In cases like this  language co activation occurs because what the listener hears could map onto words in either language   C Having to deal with this persistent linguistic competition can result in difficulties  however  For instance  knowing more than one language can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly  and can increase  tip of the tongue states   when you can almost  but ot quite  bring a word to mind  As a result  the constant juggling of two languages creates a eed to control how much a person accesses a language at any given time  For this reason  bilingual people often perform better on tasks that require conflict management  In the classic Stroop Task  people see a word and are asked to ame the colour of the word s font  When the colour and the word match  i e   the word  red  printed in red   people correctly ame the colour more quickly than when the colour and the word don t match  i e   the word  red  printed in blue   This occurs because the word itself   red   and its font colour  blue  conflict  Bilingual people often excel at tasks such as this  which tap into the ability to ignore competing perceptual information and focus on the relevant aspects of the input  Bilinguals are also better at switching between two tasks  for example  when bilinguals have to switch from categorizing objects by colour  red or green     " "X Reading to categorizing them by shape  circle or triangle   they do so more quickly than monolingual people  reflecting better cognitive control when having to make rapid clhanges of strategy   D It also seems that the eurological roots of the bilingual advantage extend to brain areas more traditionally associated with sensory processing  When monolingual aind bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds without any intervening background oise  they show highly similar brain stem responses  When researchers play the same sound to both groups in the presence of background neise  however  the bilingual listeners  eural response is considerably larger  reflecting better encoding of the sound s fundamental frequency  a feature of sound closely related to pitch perception   E Such improvements in cognitive and sensory processing may help a bilingual person to process information in the environment  and help explain why bilingual aclults acquire a third language better than monolingual adults master a second language  This advantage may be rooted in the skill of focussing on information about the ew language while reducing interference from the languages they already know   F Research also indicates that bilingual experience may help to keep the cognitive mechanisms sharp by recruiting alternate brain etworks to compensate for those thatbecome damaged during aging  Older bilinguals enjoy improved memory relative to monolingual people  which can lead to real world health benefits  In a study of over  patients with Alzheimer s disease  a degenerative brain disease  bilingual patients reported showing initial symptoms of the disease an average of five years later than monolingual patients  In a follow up study  researchers compared the brains of bilingual and monolingual patients matched on the severity of Alzheimer s symptoms  Surprisingly  the bilinguals  brains had more physical signs of disease than their monolingual counterparts  even though their outward behaviour and abilities were the same  If the brain is an engine  bilingualism may help it to go farther on the same amount of fuel   G Furthermore  the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to start very early  In one study  researchers taught seven month old babies growing up  in monolingual or bilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound  a puppet appeared on one side of a screen  Halfway through the study  the puppet began appearing on the opposite side of the screen  In order to get a reward  the infants had to adjust the rule they d learned  only the bilingual babies were able to successfully learn the ew rule  This suggests that for very young children  as well as for older people  avigating a multilingual environment imparts advantages that  transfer far beyond language    " "X Test

reintroduction programme has helped conservationists take significant steps to protect the endangered Galapagos tortoise   A Forests of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains that separate the interior of the Galapagos island of Isabela from the Pacific Ocean  With its five distinct volcanoes  the island resembles a lunar landscape  Only the thick vegetation at the skirt of the often cloud covered peak of Sierra Negra offers respite from the barren terrain below  This inhospitable environment is home to the giant Galapagos tortoise  Some time after the Galapagos s birth  around five million years ago  the islands were colonised by one or more tortoises from mainland South America  As these ancestral tortoises settled on the individual islands  the different populations adapted to their unique environments  giving rise to at least  different subspecies  Island life agreed with them  In the absence of significant predators  they grew to become the largest and longest living tortoises on the planet  weighing more than  kilograms  occasionally exceeding   metres in length and living for more than a century   B Before human arrival  the archipelago s tortoises umbered in the hundreds of thousands  From the th century onwards  pirates took a few on board for food  but the arrival of whaling ships in the s saw this exploitation grow exponentially  Relatively immobile and capable of surviving for months without food or water  the tortoises were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies during long ocean passages  Sometimes  their bodies were processed into high  grade oil  In total  an estimated   animals were taken from the archipelago before the th century  This historical exploitation was then exacerbated when settlers came to the islands  They hunted the tortoises and destroyed their habitat to clear land for agriculture  They also introduced alien species   ranging from cattle  pigs  goats  rats and dogs to plants and ants   that either prey on the eggs and young tortoises or damage or destroy their habitat   C Today  only  of the original subspecies survive and of these  several are highly endangered  In   work began on a tortoise breeding centre just outside the town of Puerto Villamil on Isabela  dedicated to protecting the island s tortoise populations  The centre s captive breeding programme proved to be extremely successful  and it eventually had to deal with an overpopulation problem   D  The problem was also a pressing one  Captive bred tortoises can t be reintroduced into the wild until they re at least five years old and weigh at least   kilograms  at which point their size and weight   and their hardened shells   are sufficient to protect them from predators  But if people wait too long after that point  the tortoises eventually become too large to transport     " "X Reading  E For years  repatriation efforts were carried out in small umbers  with the tortoises carried on the backs of men over weeks of long  treacherous hikes along arrow trails  But in November   the environmentalist and Galapagos National Park liaison officer Godfrey Merlin  a visiting private motor yacht captain and a helicopter pilot gathered around a table in a small caf� in Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz to work out more ambitious reintroduction  The aim was to use a helicopter to move  of the breeding centre s tortoises to various locations close to Sierra Negra   F This unprecedented effort was made possible by the owners of the  metre yacht White Cloud  who provided the Galapagos National Park with free use of their helicopter and its experienced pilot  as well as the logistical support of the yacht  its captain and crew  Originally an air ambulance  the yacht s helicopter has a rear double door and a large internal space that s well suited for cargo  so a custom crate was designed to hold up to  tortoises with a total weight of about  kilograms  This weight  together with that of the fuel  pilot and four crew  approached the helicopter s maximum payload  and there were times when it was clearly right on the edge of the helicopter s capabilities  During a period of three days  a group of volunteers from the breeding centre worked around the clock to prepare the young tortoises for transport  Meanwhile  park wardens  dropped off ahead of time in remote locations  cleared landing sites within the thick brush  cacti and lava rocks   G Upon their release  the juvenile tortoises quickly spread out over their ancestral territory  investigating their ew surroundings and feeding on the vegetation  Eventually  one tiny tortoise came across a fully grown giant who had been lumbering around the island for around a hundred years  The two stood side by side  a powerful symbol of the regeneration of an ancient species     " "X Test   Questions    Complete the otes below   Choose ONE WORD ONLY from the passage for each answer   Write your answers in boxes   on your

Geography  A While many diseases that affect humans have been eradicated due to improvements in vaccinations and the availability of healthcare  there are still areas around the world where certain health issues are more prevalent  In a world that is far more globalised than ever before  people come into contact with one another through travel and living closer and closer to each other  As a result  super viruses and other infections resistant to antibiotics are becoming more and more common   B Geography can often play a very large role in the health concerns of certain populations  For instance  depending on where you live  you will ot have the same health concerns as someone who lives in a different geographical region  Perhaps one of the most obvious examples of this idea is malaria prone areas  which are usually tropical regions that foster a warm and damp environment in which the mosquitos that can give people this disease can grow  Malaria is much less of a problem in high altitude deserts  for instance   CG Insome countries  geographical factors influence the health and well being of the population in very obvious ways  In many large cities  the wind is ot strong enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution that cause asthma  lung problems  eyesight issues and more in the people who live there  Part of the problem is  of course  the massive umber of cars being driven  in addition to factories that run on coal power  The rapid industrialisation of some countries in recent years has also led to the cutting down of forests to allow for the expansion of big cities  which makes it even harder to fight the pollution with the fresh air that is produced by plants   D  Itis in situations like these that the field of health geography comes into its own  It is an increasingly important area of study in a world where diseases like polio are re emerging  respiratory diseases continue to spread  and malaria prone areas are still fighting to find a better cure  Health geography is the combination of  on the one hand  knowledge regarding geography and methods used to analyse and interpret geographical information  and on the other  the study of health  diseases and healthcare practices around the world  The aim of this hybrid science is to create solutions for common geography based health problems  While people will always be prone to illness  the study of how geography affects our health could lead to the eradication of certain illnesses  and the prevention of others in the future  By understanding why and how we get sick  we can change the way we treat illness and disease specific to certain geographical locations     " "X Test   E The geography of disease and ill health analyses the frequency with which certain diseases appear in different parts of the world  and overlays the data with the geography of the region  to see if there could be a correlation between the two  Health geographers also study factors that could make certain individuals or a population more likely to be taken ill with a specific health concern or disease  as compared with the population of another area  Health geographers in this field are usually trained as healthcare workers  and have an understanding of basic epidemiology as it relates to the spread of diseases among the population   F Researchers study the interactions between humans and their environment that could lead to illness  such as asthma in places with high levels of pollution  and work to create a clear way of categorising illnesses  diseases and epidemics into local and global scales  Health geographers can map the spread of illnesses and attempt to identify the reasons behind an increase or decrease in illnesses  as they work to find a way to halt the further spread or re emergence of diseases in vulnerable populations   G The second subcategory of health geography is the geography of healthcare provision  This group studies the availability  or lack thereof  of healthcare resources to individuals and populations around the world  In both developed and developing ations there is often a very large discrepancy between the options available to people in different social classes  income brackets  and levels of education  Individuals working in the area of the geography of healthcare provision attempt to assess the levels of healthcare in the area  for instance  it may be very difficult for people to get medical attention because there is a mountain between their village and the earest hospital   These researchers are on the frontline of making recommendations regarding policy to international organisations  local government bodies and others   H  The field of health geography is often overlooked  but it

power of music Why does music make us feel  On the one hand  music is a purely abstract art form  devoid of language or explicit ideas  And yet  even though music says little  it still manages to touch us deeply  When listening to our favourite songs  our body betrays all the symptoms of emotional arousal  The pupils in our eyes dilate  our pulse and blood pressure rise  the electrical conductance of our skin is lowered  and the cerebellum  a brain region associated with bodily movement  becomes strangely active  Blood is even re directed to the muscles in our legs  In other words  sound stirs us at our biological roots  Arecent paper in Nature Neuroscience by a research team in Montreal  Canada  marks an important step in revealing the precise underpinnings of  the potent pleasurable stimulus  that is music  Although the study involves plenty of fancy technology  including functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI  and ligand based positron emission tomography  PET  scanning  the experiment itself was rather straightforward  After screening  individuals who responded to advertisements requesting people who experience  chills  to instrumental music  the scientists arrowed down the subject pool to ten  They then asked the subjects to bring in their playlist of favourite songs   virtually every genre was represented  from techno to tango   and played them the music while their brain activity was monitored  Because the scientists were combining methodologies  PET and fMRI   they were able to obtain an impressively exact and detailed portrait of music in the brain  The first thing they discovered is that music triggers the production of dopamine   a chemical with a key role in setting people s moods   by the eurons  erve cells  in both the dorsal and ventral regions of the brain  As these two regions have long been linked with the experience of pleasure  this finding isn t particularly surprising  What is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine eurons in the caudate   a region of the brain involved in learning stimulus response associations  and in anticipating food and other  reward  stimuli   were at their most active around  seconds before the participants  favourite moments in the music  The researchers call this the  anticipatory phase  and argue that the purpose of this activity is to help us predict the arrival of our favourite part  The question  of course  is what all these dopamine eurons are up to  Why are they so active in the period preceding the acoustic climax  After all  we typically associate surges of dopamine with pleasure  with the processing of actual rewards  And yet  this cluster of cells is most active when the  chills  have yet to arrive  when the melodic pattern is still unresolved    " "X Reading One way to answer the question is to look at the music and ot the eurons  While music can often seem  at least to the outsider  like a labyrinth of intricate patterns  it turns out that the most important part of every song or symphony is when the patterns break down  when the sound becomes unpredictable  If the music is too obvious  it is annoyingly boring  like an alarm clock  Numerous studies  after all  have demonstrated that dopamine eurons quickly adapt to predictable rewards  If we know what s going to happen ext  then we don t get excited  This is why composers often introduce a key ote in the beginning of a song  spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious avoidance of the pattern  and then finally repeat it only at the end  The longer we are denied the pattern we expect  the greater the emotional release when the pattern returns  safe and sound  To demonstrate this psychological principle  the musicologist Leonard Meyer  in his classic book Emotion and Meaning in Music     analysed the th movement of Beethoven s String Quartet in C sharp minor  Op    Meyer wanted to show how music is defined by its flirtation with   but ot submission to   our expectations of order  Meyer dissected  measures  bars  of the masterpiece  showing how Beethoven begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern and then  in an ingenious tonal dance  carefully holds off repeating it  What Beethoven does instead is suggest variations of the pattern  He wants to preserve an element of uncertainty in his music  making our brains beg for the one chord he refuses to give us  Beethoven saves that chord for the end  According to Meyer  it is the suspenseful tension of music  arising out of our unfulfilled expectations  that is the source of the music s feeling  While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences   its  connotative  meaning   Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the unfolding events of the music itself  This  embodied meaning  arises from the patterns the symphony invokes and then ignores  It is this uncertainty that triggers the surge of dopamine in the caudate  as we struggle to figure out what will happen ext  We can predict some of the otes  but we can t predict them all  and that is what keeps us listening  waiting expectantly for our reward  for the pattern to be completed     " "X Test  Questions   Complete the summary below  Choose NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage for each answer

blame has been spread far and wide  Governments  regulators  central banks and auditors have all been in the frame  The role of bank directors and management and their widely publicised failures have been extensively picked over and examined in reports  inquiries and commentaries   B The knock on effect of this scrutiny has been to make the governance of companies in general an issue of intense public debate and has significantly increased the pressures on  and the responsibilities of  directors  At the simplest and most practical level  the time involved in fulfilling the demands of a board directorship has increased significantly  calling into question the effectiveness of the classic model of corporate governance by part time  independent on executive directors  Where once a board schedule may have consisted of between eight and ten meetings a year  in many companies the umber of events requiring board input and decisions has dramatically risen  Furthermore  the amount of reading and preparation required for each meeting is increasing  Agendas can become overloaded and this can mean the time for constructive debate must ecessarily be restricted in favour of getting through the business   C Often  board business is devolved to committees in order to cope with the workload  which may be more efficient but can mean that the board as a whole is less involved in fully addressing some of the most important issues  It is ot uncommon for the audit committee meeting to last longer than the main board meeting itself  Process may take the place of discussion and be at the expense of real collaboration  so that boxes are ticked rather than issues tackled   D Aradical solution  which may work for some very large companies whose businesses are extensive and complex  is the professional board  whose members would work up to three or four days a week  supported by their own dedicated staff and advisers  There are obvious  risks to this and it would be important to establish clear guidelines for such a board to ensure that it did ot step on the toes of management by becoming too engaged in the day to day running of the company  Problems of recruitment  remuneration and independence could also arise and this structure would ot be appropriate for all companies  However  more professional and better informed boards would have been particularly appropriate for banks where the executives had access to information that part time on executive directors lacked  leaving the latter unable to comprehend or anticipate the  crash     " "X Test   E One of the main criticisms of boards and their directors is that they do ot focus sufficiently on longer term matters of strategy  sustainability and governance  but instead concentrate too much on short term financial metrics  Regulatory requirements and the structure of the market encourage this behaviour  The tyranny of quarterly reporting can distort board decision making  as directors have to  make the umbers  every four months to meet the insatiable appetite of the market for more data  This serves to encourage the trading methodology of a certain kind of investor who moves in and out of a stock without engaging in constructive dialogue with the company about strategy or performance  and is simply seeking a short  term financial gain  This effect has been made worse by the changing profile of investors due to the globalisation of capital and the increasing use of automated trading systems  Corporate culture adapts and management teams are largely incentivised to meet financial goals   F Compensation for chief executives has become a combat zone where pitched battles between investors  management and board members are fought  often behind closed doors but increasingly frequently in the full glare of press attention  Many would argue that this is in the interest of transparency and good governance as shareholders use their muscle in the area of pay to pressure boards to remove underperforming chief executives  Their powers to vote down executive remuneration policies increased when binding votes came into force  The chair of the remuneration committee can be an exposed and lonely role  as Alison Carnwath  chair of Barclays Bank s remuneration committee  found when she had to resign  having been roundly criticised for trying to defend the enormous bonus to be paid to the chief executive  the irony being that she was widely understood to have spoken out against it in the privacy of the committee   G The financial crisis stimulated a debate about the role and purpose of the company and a heightened awareness of corporate ethics  Trust in the corporation has been eroded and academics such as Michael Sandel  in his thoughtful and bestselling book What Money Can t Buy  are questioning the morality of capitalism and the market economy  Boards of companies in all sectors will eed to widen their perspective to encompass these issues and this may involve a realignment of corporate goals  We live in challenging times     " "X Reading Questions   Do the following statements agree with the claims of the writer in Reading Passage   In boxes   on

What's the purpose of gaining knowledge?

A �T would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any
subject � That was the founder�s motto for Cornell University, and it seems an apt
characterization of the different university, also in the USA, where I currently teach
philosophy  A student can prepare for a career in resort management, enginecring,
interior design, accounting, music, law enforcement, you name it  But what would
the founders of these two institutions have thought of a course called �Arson for Profit?
I kid you not: we have it on the books  Any undergraduates who have met the academic
requirements can sign up for the course in our program in �fire science� 

B Naturally, the course is intended for prospective arson investigators, who can learn all
the tricks of the trade for detecting whether a fire was deliberately set, discovering who
did it, and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law 
But wouldn't this also be the perfect course for prospective arsonists to sign up for? My
point is not to criticize academic programs in fire science: they are highly welcome as
part of the increasing professionalization of this and many other occupations  However,
irs not unknown for a firefighter to torch a building  This example suggests how
dishonest and illegal behavior, with the help of higher education, can creep into every
aspect of public and business life 

C I realized this anew when | was invited to speak before a class in marketing, which is
another of our degree programs  The regular instructor is a colleague who appreciates
the kind of ethical perspective I can bring as a philosopher  There are endless ways
I could have approached this assignment, but I took my cue from the title of the
course: �Principles of Marketing�  It made me think to ask the students, �Is marketing
principled?� After all, a subject matter can have principles in the sense of being codified,
having rules, as with football or chess, without being principled in the sense of being
ethical  Many of the students immediately assumed that the answer to my question
about marketing principles was obvious: no  Just look at the ways in which everything
under the sun has been marketed; obviously it need not be done in a principled
(=ethical) fashion 

D Is that obvious? I made the suggestion, which may sound downright crazy in light of
the evidence, that perhaps marketing is by definition principled  My inspiration for this
judgement is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that any body of knowledge
consists of an end (or purpose) and a means 


" "Reading

E Let us apply both the terms �means� and �end� to marketing  The students have signed
up for a course in order to learn how to market effectively  But to what end? There seem
to be two main attitudes toward that question  One is that the answer is obvious: the
purpose of marketing is to sell things and to make money  The other attitude is that the
purpose of marketing is irrelevant: Each person comes to the program and course with
his or her own plans, and these need not even concern the acquisition of marketing
expertise as such  My proposal, which I believe would also be Kant�s, is that neither of
these attitudes captures the significance of the end to the means for marketing  A field
of knowledge or a professional endeavor is defined by both the means and the end;
hence both deserve scrutiny  Students need to study both how to achieve X, and also
what X is 

F � Icis at this point that �Arson for Profit� becomes supremely relevant  That course is
presumably all about means: how to detect and prosecute criminal activity  It is therefore
assumed that the end is good in an ethical sense  When I ask fire science students to
articulate the end, or purpose, of their field, they eventually generalize to something like,
�The safety and welfare of society, which seems right  As we have seen, someone could
use the very same knowledge of means to achieve a much less noble end, such as personal
profit via destructive, dangerous, reckless activity  But we would not call that firefighting 
We have a separate word for it: azson  Similarly, if you employed the �principles of
marketing� in an unprincipled way, you would not be doing marketing  We have another
term for it: fraud  Kant gives the example of a doctor and a poisoner, who use the
identical knowledge to achieve their divergent ends  We would say that one is practicing
medicine, the other, murder  :

Passage  below 

The risks agriculture faces in developing countries
Synthesis of an online debate*

A Two things distinguish food production from all other productive activities: first,
every single person needs food each day and has a right to it; and second, it is
hugely dependent on nature  These two unique aspects, one political, the other
natural, make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other
business  At the same time, cultural values are highly entrenched in food and
agricultural systems worldwide 

B Farmers everywhere face major risks, including extreme weather, long-term
climate change, and price volatility in input and product markets  However,
smallholder farmers in developing countries must in addition deal with adverse
environments, both natural, in terms of soil quality, rainfall, etc , and human, in
terms of infrastructure, financial systems, markets, knowledge and technology 
Counter-intuitively, hunger is prevalent among many smallholder farmers in the
developing world 

C Participants in the online debate argued that our biggest challenge is to address the
underlying causes of the agricultural system�s inability to ensure sufficient food for
all, and they identified as drivers of this problem our dependency on fossil fuels and
unsupportive government policies 

D On the question of mitigating the risks farmers face, most essayists called for
greater state intervention  In his essay, Kanayo F  Nwanze, President of the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, argued that governments can
significantly reduce risks for farmers by providing basic services like roads to get
produce more efficiently to markets, or water and food storage facilities to reduce
losses  Sophia Murphy, senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade
Policy, suggested that the procurement and holding of stocks by governments
can also help mitigate wild swings in food prices by alleviating uncertainties about
market supply 

*The personal names in the text refer to the authors of written contributions to the online debate 


" "Reading

E �Shenggen Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research
Institute, held up social safety nets and public welfare programmes in Ethiopia,
Brazil and Mexico as valuable ways to address poverty among farming families
and reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks  However, some commentators
responded that cash transfers to poor families do not necessarily translate into
increased food security, as these programmes do not always strengthen food
production or raise incomes  Regarding state subsidies for agriculture, Rokeya
Kabir, Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha, commented in her
essay that these �have not compensated for the stranglehold exercised by private
traders  In fact, studies show that sixty percent of beneficiaries of subsidies are not
poor, but rich landowners and non-farmer traders �

F  Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private risk management tools, like private
insurance, commodity futures markets, and rural finance can help small-scale
producers mitigate risk and allow for investment in improvements  Kabir warned
that financial support schemes often encourage the adoption of high-input
agricultural practices, which in the medium term may raise production costs
beyond the value of their harvests  Murphy noted that when futures markets
become excessively financialised they can contribute to short-term price volatility,
which increases farmers� food insecurity  Many participants and commentators
emphasised that greater transparency in markets is needed to mitigate the impact
of volatility, and make evident whether adequate stocks and supplies are available 
Others contended that agribusiness companies should be held responsible for
paying for negative side effects 

G Many essayists mentioned climate change and its consequences for small-scale
agriculture  Fan explained that �in addition to reducing crop yields, climate change
increases the magnitude and the frequency of extreme weather events, which
increase smallholder vulnerability � The growing unpredictability of weather patterns
increases farmers� difficulty in managing weather-related risks  According to this
author, one solution would be to develop crop varieties that are more resilient
to new climate trends and extreme weather patterns  Accordingly, Pat Mooney,
co-founder and executive director of the ETC Group, suggested that �if we are to
survive climate change, we must adopt policies that let peasants diversify the plant
and animal species and varieties/breeds that make up our menus �


" "Test 

H = Some participating authors and commentators argued in favour of community-
based and autonomous risk management strategies through collective action
groups, co-operatives or producers� groups  Such groups enhance market
opportunities for small-scale producers, reduce marketing costs and synchronise
buying and selling with seasonal price conditions  According to Murphy, �collective
action offers an important way for farmers to strengthen their political and economic
bargaining power, and to reduce their business risks � One commentator, Giel Ton,
warned that collective action does not come as a free good  It takes time, effort
and money to organise, build trust and to experiment  Others, like Marcel Vernooij
and Marcel Beukeboom, suggested that in order to �apply what we already know�,
all stakeholders, including business, government, scientists and civil society, must
work together, starting at the beginning of the value chain 

I Some participants explained that market price volatility is often worsened by the
presence of intermediary purchasers who, taking advantage of farmers� vulnerability,
dictate prices  One commentator suggested farmers can gain greater control over
prices and minimise price volatility by selling directly to consumers  Similarly, Sonali
Bisht, founder and advisor to the Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research
and Education (INHERE), India, wrote that community-supported agriculture, where
consumers invest in local farmers by subscription and guarantee producers a fair
price, is a risk-sharing model worth more attention  Direct food distribution systems
not only encourage small-scale agriculture but also give consumers more control
over the food they consume, she wrote

The Lost City
An explorer�s encounter with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, the most famous
icon of the Inca civilisation

A When the US explorer and academic Hiram Bingham arrived in South America in

, he was ready for what was to be the greatest achievement of his life: the
exploration of the remote hinterland to the west of Cusco, the old capital of the Inca
empire in the Andes mountains of Peru  His goal was to locate the remains of a city
called Vitcos, the last capital of the Inca civilisation  Cusco lies on a high plateau

at an elevation of more than , metres, and Bingham�s plan was to descend
from this plateau along the valley of the Urubamba river, which takes a circuitous
route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons and
mountain ranges 

B When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba in late July, they had
an advantage over travellers who had preceded them: a track had recently been
blasted down the valley canyon to enable rubber to be brought up by mules from
the jungle  Almost all previous travellers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and
taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the river lower down, thereby
cutting a subsiantial corner, but also therefore never passing through the area
around Machu Picchu 

C On  July they were a few days into their descent of the valley  The day began
slowly, with Bingham trying to arrange sufficient mules for the next stage of the
trek  His companions showed no interest in accompanying him up the nearby hill
to see some ruins that a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, had told them about the
night before  The morning was dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have
been less than keen on the prospect of climbing the hill  In his book Lost City of the
Incas, he relates that he made the ascent without having the least expectation that
he would find anything at the top 

D Bingham writes about the approach in vivid style in his book  First, as he climbs
up the hill, he describes the ever-present possibility of deadly snakes, �capable of
making considerable springs when in pursuit of their prey�; not that he sees any 
Then there�s a sense of mounting discovery as he comes across great sweeps
of terraces, then a mausoleum, followed by monumental staircases and, finally,
the grand ceremonial buildings of Machu Picchu  �It seemed like an unbelievable
dream     the sight held me spellbound    � he wrote 


" "Test 

� We should remember, however, that Lost City of the Incas is a work of hindsight,
not written until , many years after his journey  His journal entries of the
time reveal a much more gradual appreciation of his achievement  He spent
the afternoon at the ruins noting down the dimensions of some of the buildings,
then descended and rejoined his companions, to whom he seems to have said
little about his discovery  At this stage, Bingham didn�t realise the extent or the
importance of the site, nor did he realise what use he could make of the discovery 

F However, soon after returning it occurred to him that he could make a name for
himself from this discovery  When he came to write the National Geographic
magazine article that broke the story to the world in April , he knew he had
to produce a big idea  He wondered whether it could have been the birthplace of
the very first Inca, Manco the Great, and whether it could also have been what
chroniclers described as �the last city of the Incas�  This term refers to Vilcabamba,
the settlement where the Incas had fled from Spanish invaders in the s 
Bingham made desperate attempts to prove this belief for nearly  years  Sadly,
his vision of the site as both the beginning and end of the Inca civilisation, while
a magnificent one, is inaccurate  We now know that Vilcabamba actually lies 
kilometres away in the depths of the jungle 

G One question that has perplexed visitors, historians and archaeologists alike ever
since Bingham, is why the site seems to have been abandoned before the Spanish
Conquest  There are no references to it by any of the Spanish chroniclers � and if
they had known of its existence so close to Cusco they would certainly have come
in search of gold  An idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past few
years is that Machu Picchu was a moya, a country estate built by an Inca emperor
to escape the cold winters of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental
architecture and spectacular views  Furthermore, the particular architecture of
Machu Picchu suggests that it was constructed at the time of the greatest of all the
Incas, the emperor Pachacuti (c  -)  By custom, Pachacuti�s descendants
built other similar estates for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been
abandoned after his death, some  years before the Spanish Conquest

Passage  below 

The Benefits of Being Bilingual

A According to the latest figures, the majority of the world�s population is now bilingual
or multilingual, having grown up speaking two or more languages  In the past, such
children were considered to be at a disadvantage compared with their monolingual
peers  Over the past few decades, however, technological advances have allowed
researchers to look more deeply at how bilingualism interacts with and changes
the cognitive and neurological systems, thereby identifying several clear benefits of
being bilingual 

B Research shows that when a bilingual person uses one language, the other is
active at the same time  When we hear a word, we don�t hear the entire word all at
once: the sounds arrive in sequential order  Long before the word is finished, the
brain�s language system begins to guess what that word might be  If you hear �can�,
you will likely activate words like �candy� and �candle� as well, at least during the
earlier stages of word recognition  For bilingual people, this activation is not limited
to a single language; auditory input activates corresponding words regardless
of the language to which they belong  Some of the most compelling evidence
for this phenomenon, called �language co-activation�, comes from studying eye
movements  A Russian-English bilingual asked to �pick up a marker� from a set of
objects would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn�t know Russian,
because the Russian word for �stamp�, marka, sounds like the English word he or
she heard, �marker�  In cases like this, language co-activation occurs because what
the listener hears could map onto words in either language 

C Having to deal with this persistent linguistic competition can result in difficulties,
however  For instance, knowing more than one language can cause speakers to
name pictures more slowly, and can increase �tip-of-the-tongue states�, when you
can almost, but not quite, bring a word to mind  As a result, the constant juggling of
two languages creates a need to control how much a person accesses a language
at any given time  For this reason, bilingual people often perform better on tasks
that require conflict management  In the classic Stroop Task, people see a word
and are asked to name the colour of the word�s font  When the colour and the
word match (i e , the word �red� printed in red), people correctly name the colour
more quickly than when the colour and the word don�t match (i e , the word �red�
printed in blue)  This occurs because the word itself (�red�) and its font colour (blue)
conflict  Bilingual people often excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability
to ignore competing perceptual information and focus on the relevant aspects of
the input  Bilinguals are also better at switching between two tasks; for example,
when bilinguals have to switch from categorizing objects by colour (red or green)


" "Reading
to categorizing them by shape (circle or triangle), they do so more quickly than
monolingual people, reflecting better cognitive control when having to make rapid
clhanges of strategy 

D It also seems that the neurological roots of the bilingual advantage extend to brain
areas more traditionally associated with sensory processing  When monolingual
aind bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds without any intervening
background noise, they show highly similar brain stem responses  When
researchers play the same sound to both groups in the presence of background
neise, however, the bilingual listeners� neural response is considerably larger,
reflecting better encoding of the sound�s fundamental frequency, a feature of sound
closely related to pitch perception 

E Such improvements in cognitive and sensory processing may help a bilingual
person to process information in the environment, and help explain why bilingual
aclults acquire a third language better than monolingual adults master a second
language  This advantage may be rooted in the skill of focussing on information
about the new language while reducing interference from the languages they
already know 

F Research also indicates that bilingual experience may help to keep the cognitive
mechanisms sharp by recruiting alternate brain networks to compensate for those
thatbecome damaged during aging  Older bilinguals enjoy improved memory
relative to monolingual people, which can lead to real-world health benefits  In a
study of over  patients with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disease,
bilingual patients reported showing initial symptoms of the disease an average
of five years later than monolingual patients  In a follow-up study, researchers
compared the brains of bilingual and monolingual patients matched on the severity
of Alzheimer�s symptoms  Surprisingly, the bilinguals� brains had more physical
signs of disease than their monolingual counterparts, even though their outward
behaviour and abilities were the same  If the brain is an engine, bilingualism may
help it to go farther on the same amount of fuel 

G Furthermore, the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to start
very early  In one study, researchers taught seven-month-old babies growing
up� in monolingual or bilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound, a
puppet appeared on one side of a screen  Halfway through the study, the puppet
began appearing on the opposite side of the screen  In order to get a reward, the
infants had to adjust the rule they'd learned; only the bilingual babies were able to
successfully learn the new rule  This suggests that for very young children, as well
as for older people, navigating a multilingual environment imparts advantages that

transfer far beyond language

Flying tortoises
An airborne reintroduction programme has helped conservationists take
significant steps to protect the endangered Galapagos tortoise 

A Forests of spiny cacti cover much of the uneven lava plains that separate the
interior of the Galapagos island of Isabela from the Pacific Ocean  With its
five distinct volcanoes, the island resembles a lunar landscape  Only the thick
vegetation at the skirt of the often cloud-covered peak of Sierra Negra offers respite
from the barren terrain below  This inhospitable environment is home to the giant
Galapagos tortoise  Some time after the Galapagos's birth, around five million
years ago, the islands were colonised by one or more tortoises from mainland
South America  As these ancestral tortoises settled on the individual islands, the
different populations adapted to their unique environments, giving rise to at least
 different subspecies  Island life agreed with them  In the absence of significant
predators, they grew to become the largest and longest-living tortoises on the
planet, weighing more than  kilograms, occasionally exceeding   metres in
length and living for more than a century 

B Before human arrival, the archipelago�s tortoises numbered in the hundreds
of thousands  From the th century onwards, pirates took a few on board for
food, but the arrival of whaling ships in the s saw this exploitation grow
exponentially  Relatively immobile and capable of surviving for months without food
or water, the tortoises were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies
during long ocean passages  Sometimes, their bodies were processed into high-
grade oil  In total, an estimated , animals were taken from the archipelago
before the th century  This historical exploitation was then exacerbated when
settlers came to the islands  They hunted the tortoises and destroyed their habitat
to clear land for agriculture  They also introduced alien species � ranging from
cattle, pigs, goats, rats and dogs to plants and ants � that either prey on the eggs
and young tortoises or damage or destroy their habitat 

C Today, only  of the original subspecies survive and of these, several are highly
endangered  In , work began on a tortoise-breeding centre just outside the
town of Puerto Villamil on Isabela, dedicated to protecting the island�s tortoise
populations  The centre�s captive-breeding programme proved to be extremely
successful, and it eventually had to deal with an overpopulation problem 

D  The problem was also a pressing one  Captive-bred tortoises can�t be reintroduced
into the wild until they�re at least five years old and weigh at least   kilograms,
at which point their size and weight � and their hardened shells � are sufficient
to protect them from predators  But if people wait too long after that point, the
tortoises eventually become too large to transport 


" "Reading

E For years, repatriation efforts were carried out in small numbers, with the tortoises
carried on the backs of men over weeks of long, treacherous hikes along narrow
trails  But in November , the environmentalist and Galapagos National Park
liaison officer Godfrey Merlin, a visiting private motor yacht captain and a helicopter
pilot gathered around a table in a small caf� in Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa
Cruz to work out more ambitious reintroduction  The aim was to use a helicopter
to move  of the breeding centre�s tortoises to various locations close to Sierra
Negra 

F This unprecedented effort was made possible by the owners of the -metre
yacht White Cloud, who provided the Galapagos National Park with free use of
their helicopter and its experienced pilot, as well as the logistical support of the
yacht, its captain and crew  Originally an air ambulance, the yacht�s helicopter
has a rear double door and a large internal space that�s well suited for cargo,
so a custom crate was designed to hold up to  tortoises with a total weight of
about  kilograms  This weight, together with that of the fuel, pilot and four crew,
approached the helicopter�s maximum payload, and there were times when it was
clearly right on the edge of the helicopter�s capabilities  During a period of three
days, a group of volunteers from the breeding centre worked around the clock to
prepare the young tortoises for transport  Meanwhile, park wardens, dropped off
ahead of time in remote locations, cleared landing sites within the thick brush, cacti
and lava rocks 

G Upon their release, the juvenile tortoises quickly spread out over their ancestral
territory, investigating their new surroundings and feeding on the vegetation 
Eventually, one tiny tortoise came across a fully grown giant who had been
lumbering around the island for around a hundred years  The two stood side by
side, a powerful symbol of the regeneration of an ancient species

Passage  
The Intersection of Health Sciences and Geography

A While many diseases that affect humans have been eradicated due to
improvements in vaccinations and the availability of healthcare, there are still areas
around the world where certain health issues are more prevalent  In a world that is
far more globalised than ever before, people come into contact with one another
through travel and living closer and closer to each other  As a result, super-viruses
and other infections resistant to antibiotics are becoming more and more common 

B Geography can often play a very large role in the health concerns of certain
populations  For instance, depending on where you live, you will not have the same
health concerns as someone who lives in a different geographical region  Perhaps
one of the most obvious examples of this idea is malaria-prone areas, which are
usually tropical regions that foster a warm and damp environment in which the
mosquitos that can give people this disease can grow  Malaria is much less of a
problem in high-altitude deserts, for instance 

CG Insome countries, geographical factors influence the health and well-being of
the population in very obvious ways  In many large cities, the wind is not strong
enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution that cause
asthma, lung problems, eyesight issues and more in the people who live there  Part
of the problem is, of course, the massive number of cars being driven, in addition
to factories that run on coal power  The rapid industrialisation of some countries in
recent years has also led to the cutting down of forests to allow for the expansion of
big cities, which makes it even harder to fight the pollution with the fresh air that is
produced by plants 

D  Itis in situations like these that the field of health geography comes into its own  It
is an increasingly important area of study in a world where diseases like polio are
re-emerging, respiratory diseases continue to spread, and malaria-prone areas
are still fighting to find a better cure  Health geography is the combination of, on
the one hand, knowledge regarding geography and methods used to analyse and
interpret geographical information, and on the other, the study of health, diseases
and healthcare practices around the world  The aim of this hybrid science is to
create solutions for common geography-based health problems  While people will
always be prone to illness, the study of how geography affects our health could
lead to the eradication of certain illnesses, and the prevention of others in the
future  By understanding why and how we get sick, we can change the way we
treat illness and disease specific to certain geographical locations 


" "Test 

E The geography of disease and ill health analyses the frequency with which certain
diseases appear in different parts of the world, and overlays the data with the
geography of the region, to see if there could be a correlation between the two 
Health geographers also study factors that could make certain individuals or a
population more likely to be taken ill with a specific health concern or disease, as
compared with the population of another area  Health geographers in this field
are usually trained as healthcare workers, and have an understanding of basic
epidemiology as it relates to the spread of diseases among the population 

F Researchers study the interactions between humans and their environment that
could lead to illness (such as asthma in places with high levels of pollution) and
work to create a clear way of categorising illnesses, diseases and epidemics into
local and global scales  Health geographers can map the spread of illnesses and
attempt to identify the reasons behind an increase or decrease in illnesses, as
they work to find a way to halt the further spread or re-emergence of diseases in
vulnerable populations 

G The second subcategory of health geography is the geography of healthcare
provision  This group studies the availability (or lack thereof) of healthcare
resources to individuals and populations around the world  In both developed and
developing nations there is often a very large discrepancy between the options
available to people in different social classes, income brackets, and levels of
education  Individuals working in the area of the geography of healthcare provision
attempt to assess the levels of healthcare in the area (for instance, it may be very
difficult for people to get medical attention because there is a mountain between
their village and the nearest hospital)  These researchers are on the frontline of
making recommendations regarding policy to international organisations, local
government bodies and others 

H  The field of health geography is often overlooked, but it constitutes a huge area
of need in the fields of geography and healthcare  If we can understand how
geography affects our health no matter where in the world we are located, we can
better treat disease, prevent illness, and keep people safe and well

Passage  
Music and the emotions

Neuroscientist Jonah Lehrer considers the emotional power of music
Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, music is a purely abstract art form,
devoid of language or explicit ideas  And yet, even though music says little, it still
manages to touch us deeply  When listening to our favourite songs, our body betrays all
the symptoms of emotional arousal  The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood
pressure rise, the electrical conductance of our skin is lowered, and the cerebellum, a
brain region associated with bodily movement, becomes strangely active  Blood is even
re-directed to the muscles in our legs  In other words, sound stirs us at our biological
roots 
Arecent paper in Nature Neuroscience by a research team in Montreal, Canada, marks
an important step in revealing the precise underpinnings of �the potent pleasurable
stimulus� that is music  Although the study involves plenty of fancy technology, including
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ligand-based positron emission
tomography (PET) scanning, the experiment itself was rather straightforward  After
screening  individuals who responded to advertisements requesting people who
experience �chills� to instrumental music, the scientists narrowed down the subject pool
to ten  They then asked the subjects to bring in their playlist of favourite songs � virtually
every genre was represented, from techno to tango � and played them the music while
their brain activity was monitored  Because the scientists were combining methodologies
(PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively exact and detailed portrait of
music in the brain  The first thing they discovered is that music triggers the production
of dopamine � a chemical with a key role in setting people's moods � by the neurons
(nerve cells) in both the dorsal and ventral regions of the brain  As these two regions
have long been linked with the experience of pleasure, this finding isn�t particularly
surprising 
What is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine neurons in the
caudate � a region of the brain involved in learning stimulus-response associations,
and in anticipating food and other �reward� stimuli � were at their most active around
 seconds before the participants� favourite moments in the music  The researchers
call this the �anticipatory phase� and argue that the purpose of this activity is to help
us predict the arrival of our favourite part  The question, of course, is what all these
dopamine neurons are up to  Why are they so active in the period preceding the
acoustic climax? After all, we typically associate surges of dopamine with pleasure, with
the processing of actual rewards  And yet, this cluster of cells is most active when the
�chills� have yet to arrive, when the melodic pattern is still unresolved 

" "Reading
One way to answer the question is to look at the music and not the neurons  While
music can often seem (at least to the outsider) like a labyrinth of intricate patterns, it
turns out that the most important part of every song or symphony is when the patterns
break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable  If the music is too obvious, it is
annoyingly boring, like an alarm clock  Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated
that dopamine neurons quickly adapt to predictable rewards  If we know what's going
to happen next, then we don�t get excited  This is why composers often introduce a
key note in the beginning of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious
avoidance of the pattern, and then finally repeat it only at the end  The longer we are
denied the pattern we expect, the greater the emotional release when the pattern
returns, safe and sound 
To demonstrate this psychological principle, the musicologist Leonard Meyer, in his
classic book Emotion and Meaning in Music (), analysed the th movement of
Beethoven�s String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op    Meyer wanted to show how
music is defined by its flirtation with � but not submission to � our expectations of order 
Meyer dissected  measures (bars) of the masterpiece, showing how Beethoven
begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern and then, in an
ingenious tonal dance, carefully holds off repeating it  What Beethoven does instead is
suggest variations of the pattern  He wants to preserve an element of uncertainty in his
music, making our brains beg for the one chord he refuses to give us  Beethoven saves
that chord for the end 
According to Meyer, it is the suspenseful tension of music, arising out of our unfulfilled
expectations, that is the source of the music�s feeling  While earlier theories of music
focused on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences ~ its
�connotative� meaning � Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the
unfolding events of the music itself  This �embodied meaning� arises from the patterns
the symphony invokes and then ignores  It is this uncertainty that triggers the surge
of dopamine in the caudate, as we struggle to figure out what will happen next  We
can predict some of the notes, but we can�t predict them all, and that is what keeps us
listening, waiting expectantly for our reward, for the pattern to be completed

UK companies need more effective boards of directors

A After a number of serious failures of governance (that is, how they are managed
at the highest level), companies in Britain, as well as elsewhere, should consider
radical changes to their directors� roles  It is clear that the role of a board director
today is not an easy one  Following the  financial meltdown, which resulted in
a deeper and more prolonged period of economic downturn than anyone expected,
the search for explanations in the many post-mortems of the crisis has meant
blame has been spread far and wide  Governments, regulators, central banks and
auditors have all been in the frame  The role of bank directors and management
and their widely publicised failures have been extensively picked over and
examined in reports, inquiries and commentaries 

B The knock-on effect of this scrutiny has been to make the governance of
companies in general an issue of intense public debate and has significantly
increased the pressures on, and the responsibilities of, directors  At the simplest
and most practical level, the time involved in fulfilling the demands of a board
directorship has increased significantly, calling into question the effectiveness of
the classic model of corporate governance by part-time, independent non-executive
directors  Where once a board schedule may have consisted of between eight and
ten meetings a year, in many companies the number of events requiring board
input and decisions has dramatically risen  Furthermore, the amount of reading
and preparation required for each meeting is increasing  Agendas can become
overloaded and this can mean the time for constructive debate must necessarily be
restricted in favour of getting through the business 

C Often, board business is devolved to committees in order to cope with the
workload, which may be more efficient but can mean that the board as a whole
is less involved in fully addressing some of the most important issues  It is not
uncommon for the audit committee meeting to last longer than the main board
meeting itself  Process may take the place of discussion and be at the expense of
real collaboration, so that boxes are ticked rather than issues tackled 

D Aradical solution, which may work for some very large companies whose
businesses are extensive and complex, is the professional board, whose members
would work up to three or four days a week, supported by their own dedicated staff
and advisers  There are obvious  risks to this and it would be important to establish
clear guidelines for such a board to ensure that it did not step on the toes of
management by becoming too engaged in the day-to-day running of the company 
Problems of recruitment, remuneration and independence could also arise and this
structure would not be appropriate for all companies  However, more professional
and better-informed boards would have been particularly appropriate for banks
where the executives had access to information that part-time non-executive
directors lacked, leaving the latter unable to comprehend or anticipate the 
crash 


" "Test 

E One of the main criticisms of boards and their directors is that they do not focus
sufficiently on longer-term matters of strategy, sustainability and governance,
but instead concentrate too much on short-term financial metrics  Regulatory
requirements and the structure of the market encourage this behaviour  The tyranny
of quarterly reporting can distort board decision-making, as directors have to �make
the numbers� every four months to meet the insatiable appetite of the market for
more data  This serves to encourage the trading methodology of a certain kind of
investor who moves in and out of a stock without engaging in constructive dialogue
with the company about strategy or performance, and is simply seeking a short-
term financial gain  This effect has been made worse by the changing profile of
investors due to the globalisation of capital and the increasing use of automated
trading systems  Corporate culture adapts and management teams are largely
incentivised to meet financial goals 

F Compensation for chief executives has become a combat zone where pitched
battles between investors, management and board members are fought, often
behind closed doors but increasingly frequently in the full glare of press attention 
Many would argue that this is in the interest of transparency and good governance
as shareholders use their muscle in the area of pay to pressure boards to
remove underperforming chief executives  Their powers to vote down executive
remuneration policies increased when binding votes came into force  The chair
of the remuneration committee can be an exposed and lonely role, as Alison
Carnwath, chair of Barclays Bank�s remuneration committee, found when she had
to resign, having been roundly criticised for trying to defend the enormous bonus
to be paid to the chief executive; the irony being that she was widely understood to
have spoken out against it in the privacy of the committee 

G The financial crisis stimulated a debate about the role and purpose of the company
and a heightened awareness of corporate ethics  Trust in the corporation has been
eroded and academics such as Michael Sandel, in his thoughtful and bestselling
book What Money Can't Buy, are questioning the morality of capitalism and the
market economy  Boards of companies in all sectors will need to widen their
perspective to encompass these issues and this may involve a realignment of
corporate goals  We live in challenging times
