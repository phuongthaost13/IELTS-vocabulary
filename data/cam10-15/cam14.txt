Reading Passage  below  The growth of bike sharing schemes around the world How Dutch engineer Luud Schimmelpennink helped to devise urban bike sharing schemes  A The original idea for an urban bike sharing scheme dates back to a summer s day in Amsterdam in   Provo  the organisation that came up with the idea  was a group of Dutch activists who wanted to change society  They believed the scheme  which was known as the Witte Fietsenplan  was an answer to the perceived threats of air pollution and consumerism  In the centre of Amsterdam  they painted a small number of used bikes white  They also distributed leaflets describing the dangers of cars and inviting people to use the white bikes  The bikes were then left unlocked at various locations around the city  to be used by anyone in eed of transport   B Luud Schimmelpennink  a Dutch industrial engineer who still lives and cycles in Amsterdam  was heavily involved in the original scheme  He recalls how the scheme succeeded in attracting a great deal of attention   particularly when it came to publicising Provo s aims   but struggled to get off the ground  The police were opposed to Provo s initiatives and almost as soon as the white bikes were distributed around the city  they removed them  However  for Schimmelpennink and for bike sharing schemes in general  this was just the beginning   The first Witte Fietsenplan was just a symbolic thing   he says   We painted a few bikes white  that was all  Things got more serious when   became a member of the Amsterdam city council two years later    C   Schimmelpennink seized this opportunity to present a more elaborate Witte Fietsenplan to the city council   My idea was that the municipality of Amsterdam would distribute   white bikes over the city  for everyone to use   he explains   I made serious calculations  It turned out that a white bicycle   per person  per kilometre   would cost the municipality only   of what it contributed to public transport per person per kilometre   Nevertheless  the council unanimously rejected the plan   They said that the bicycle belongs to the past  They saw a glorious future for the car   says Schimmelpennink  But he was ot in the least discouraged   D  Schimmelpennink ever stopped believing in bike sharing  and in the mid s  two Danes asked for his help to set up a system in Copenhagen  The result was the world s first large scale bike share programme  It worked on a deposit   You dropped a coin in the bike and when you returned it  you got your money back   After setting up the Danish system  Schimmelpennink decided to try his luck again    " "X Reading in the Netherlands   and this time he succeeded in arousing the interest of the Dutch Ministry of Transport   Times had changed   he recalls   People had become more environmentally conscious  and the Danish experiment had proved that bike sharing was a real possibility   A ew Witte Fietsenplan was launched in  in Amsterdam  However  riding a white bike was o longer free  it cost one guilder per trip and payment was made with a chip card developed by the Dutch bank Postbank  Schimmelpennink designed conspicuous  sturdy white bikes locked in special racks which could be opened with the chip card   the plan started with  bikes  distributed over five stations   E Theo Molenaar  who was a system designer for the project  worked alongside Schimmelpennink     remember when we were testing the bike racks  he announced that he had already designed better ones  But of course  we had to go through with the ones we had   The system  however  was prone to vandalism and theft   After every weekend there would always be a couple of bikes missing   Molenaar says      really have o idea what people did with them  because they could instantly be recognised as white bikes   But the biggest blow came when Postbank decided to abolish the chip card  because it wasn t profitable   That chip card was pivotal to the system   Molenaar says   To continue the project we would have eeded to set up another system  but the business partner had lost interest    F   Schimmelpennink was disappointed  but   characteristically   ot for long  In  he got a call from the French advertising corporation JC Decaux  who wanted to set up his bike sharing scheme in Vienna   That went really well  After Vienna  they set up a system in Lyon  Then in   Paris followed  That was a decisive moment in the history of bike sharing   The huge and unexpected success of the Parisian bike sharing programme  which ow boasts more than   bicycles  inspired cities all over the world to set up their own schemes  all modelled on Schimmelpennink s   It s wonderful that this happened   he says   But financially   didn t really benefit from it  because   ever filed for a patent    GInAmsterdam today    of all trips are made by bike and  along with Copenhagen  it is regarded as one of the two most cycle friendly capitals in the world   but the city ever got another Witte Fietsenplan  Molenaar believes this may be because everybody in Amsterdam already has a bike  Schimmelpennink  however  cannot see that this changes Amsterdam s eed for a bike sharing scheme   People who travel on the underground don t carry their bikes around   But often they eed additional transport to reach their final destination   Although he thinks it is strange that a city like Amsterdam does ot have a successful bike  sharing scheme  he is optimistic about the future   In the s we didn t stand a chance because people were prepared to give their lives to keep cars in the city  But that mentality has totally changed  Today everybody longs for cities that are ot dominated by cars      " "X Test  Questions   Reading Passage  has seven paragraphs  A G  Which paragraph

success of hotels is developing and maintaining superior performance from their employees  How is that accomplished  What Human Resource Management  HRM  practices should organizations invest in to acquire and retain great employees  Some hotels aim to provide superior working conditions for their employees  The idea originated from workplaces   usually in the on service sector   that emphasized fun and enjoyment as part of work life balance  By contrast  the service sector  and more specifically hotels  has traditionally ot extended these practices to address basic employee eeds  such as good working conditions  Pfeffer    emphasizes that in order to succeed in a global business environment  organizations must make investment in Human Resource Management  HRM  to allow them to acquire employees who possess better skills and capabilities than their competitors  This investment will be to their competitive advantage  Despite this recognition of the importance of employee development  the hospitality industry has historically been dominated by underdeveloped HR practices  Lucas     Lucas also points out that  the substance of HRM practices does ot appear to be designed to foster constructive relations with employees or to represent a managerial approach that enables developing and drawing out the full potential of people  even though employees may be broadly satisfied with many aspects of their work   Lucas     In addition  or maybe as a result  high employee turnover has been a recurring problem throughout the hospitality industry  Among the many cited reasons are low compensation  inadequate benefits  poor working conditions and compromised employee morale and attitudes  Maroudas et al      Ng and Sorensen    demonstrated that when managers provide recognition to employees  motivate employees to work together  and remove obstacles preventing effective performance  employees feel more obligated to stay with the company  This was succinctly summarized by Michel et al        P roviding support to employees gives them the confidence to perform their jobs better and the motivation to stay with the organization   Hospitality organizations can therefore enhance employee motivation and retention through the development and improvement of their working conditions  These conditions are inherently linked to the working environment  While it seems likely that employees  reactions to their job characteristics could be affected by a predisposition to view their work environment egatively  o evidence exists to support this hypothesis  Spector et al      However  given the opportunity  many people will find   " "X Test   something to complain about in relation to their workplace  Poulston     There is a strong  link between the perceptions of employees and particular factors of their work environment that are separate from the work itself  including company policies  salary and vacations   Such conditions are particularly troubling for the luxury hotel market  where high quality service  requiring a sophisticated approach to HRM  is recognized as a critical source of competitive advantage  Maroudas et al      In a real sense  the services of hotel employees represent their industry  Schneider and Bowen     This representation has commonly been limited to guest experiences  This suggests that there has been a dichotomy between the guest environment provided in luxury hotels and the working conditions of their employees   It is therefore essential for hotel management to develop HRM practices that enable them to inspire and retain competent employees  This requires an understanding of what motivates employees at different levels of management and different stages of their careers  Enz and Siguaw     This implies that it is beneficial for hotel managers to understand what practices are most favorable to increase employee satisfaction and retention   Herzberg    proposes that people have two major types of eeds  the first being extrinsic motivation factors relating to the context in which work is performed  rather than the work  itself  These include working conditions and job security  When these factors are unfavorable  job dissatisfaction may result  Significantly  though  just fulfilling these eeds does ot result in satisfaction  but only in the reduction of dissatisfaction  Maroudas et al       Employees also have intrinsic motivation eeds or motivators  which include such factors as achievement and recognition  Unlike extrinsic factors  motivator factors may ideally result in job satisfaction  Maroudas et al      Herzberg s    theory discusses the eed for a  balance  of these two types of eeds   The impact of fun as a motivating factor at work has also been explored  For example  Tews  Michel and Stafford    conducted a study focusing on staff from a chain of themed restaurants in the United States  It was found that fun activities had a favorable impact on performance and manager support for fun had a favorable impact in reducing turnover  Their findings support the view that fun may indeed have a beneficial effect  but the framing of that fun must be carefully aligned with both organizational goals and employee characteristics   Managers must learn how to achieve the delicate balance of allowing employees the freedom to enjoy themselves at work while simultaneously maintaining high levels of performance   Tews et al       Deery    has recommended several actions that can be adopted at the organizational level to retain good staff as well as assist in balancing work and family life  Those particularly appropriate to the hospitality industry include allowing adequate breaks during the working day  staff functions that involve families  and providing health and well being opportunities    " "X Reading Questions   Look at the following statements  Questions    and the list of researchers below  Match each statement with the correct

successful merchant  His grandfather  also called Alexander  had founded the family business  and later became  the first chairman of the National Bank of Scotland  The family had extensive landholdings in Scotland  Besides its residence in Edinburgh  it owned Press Estate   acres of farmland about  miles southeast of the city  The family often stayed at Press Castle  the large mansion on the northern edge of the property  and Alexander spent much of his childhood in the area  playing on the beach ear Eyemouth or fishing in the streams earby   Even after he went to school at Murcheston Academy on the outskirts of Edinburgh  Henderson returned to Press at weekends  In  he began a three year apprenticeship to become an accountant  Although he ever liked the prospect of a business career  he stayed with it to  please his family  In October   however  he emigrated to Canada with his wife Agnes Elder Robertson and they settled in Montreal   Henderson learned photography in Montreal around the year  and quickly took it up  as a serious amateur  He became a personal friend and colleague of the Scottish Canadian photographer William Notman  The two men made a photographic excursion to Niagara Falls in  and they cooperated on experiments with magnesium flares as a source of artificial light in   They belonged to the same societies and were among the founding members of the Art Association of Montreal  Henderson acted as chairman of the association s first meeting  which was held in Notman s studio on  January   In spite of their friendship  their styles of photography were quite different  While Notman s landscapes were oted for their bold realism  Henderson for the first  years of his career produced romantic images  showing the strong influence of the British landscape tradition  His artistic and technical progress was rapid and in  he published his first major collection of landscape photographs  The publication had limited circulation  only seven copies have ever been found   and was called Canadian Views and Studies  The contents of each copy vary significantly and have proved a useful source for evaluating Henderson s

photographer  From about  he dropped portraiture to specialize in landscape photography and other views  His umerous photographs of city life revealed in street scenes  houses  and markets are alive with human activity  and although his favourite subject was landscape he usually composed his scenes around such human pursuits as farming the land  cutting ice on a river  or sailing down a woodland stream  There was sufficient demand for these types of scenes and others he took depicting the lumber trade  steamboats and waterfalls to enable him to make a living  There was little competing hobby or amateur photography before the late s because of the time consuming techniques involved and the weight of the equipment  People wanted to buy photographs as souvenirs of a trip or as gifts  and catering to this market  Henderson had stock photographs on display at his studio for mounting  framing  or inclusion in albums  Henderson frequently exhibited his photographs in Montreal and abroad  in London  Edinburgh  Dublin  Paris  New York  and Philadelphia  He met with greater success in  and  in New York when he won first prizes in the exhibition held by E and H T Anthony and Company for landscapes using the Lambertype process  In  his work won second prize at the world exhibition in Paris  In the s and s Henderson travelled widely throughout Quebec and Ontario  in Canada  documenting the major cities of the two provinces and many of the villages in Quebec  He was especially fond of the wilderness and often travelled by canoe on the Blanche  du Li�vre  and other oted eastern rivers  He went on several occasions to the Maritimes and in  he sailed by yacht along the lower orth shore of the St Lawrence River  That same year  while in the lower St Lawrence River region  he took some photographs of the construction of the Intercolonial Railway  This undertaking led in  to a commission from the railway to record the principal structures along the almost completed line connecting Montreal to Halifax  Commissions from other railways followed  In  he photographed bridges on the Quebec  Montreal  Ottawa and Occidental Railway between Montreal and Ottawa  In  he went west along the Canadian Pacific Railway  CPR  as far as Rogers Pass in British Columbia  where he took photographs of the mountains and the progress of construction  In  Henderson accepted a full time position with the CPR as manager of a photographic department which he was to set up and administer  His duties included spending four months in the field each year  That summer he made his second trip west  photographing extensively along the railway line as far as Victoria  He continued in this post until   when he retired completely from photography  When Henderson died in   his huge collection of glass egatives was stored in the basement of his house  Today collections of his work are held at the National Archives of Canada  Ottawa  and the McCord Museum of Canadian History  Montreal  This

Policy makers think  you can solve energy and building problems with gadgets  You can t  As global temperatures continue to rise  we are going to continue to squander more and more energy on keeping our buildings mechanically cool until we have run out of capacity    B Short is calling for a sweeping reinvention of how skyscrapers and major public buildings are designed   to end the reliance on sealed buildings which exist solely via the  life support  system of vast air conditioning units   Instead  he shows it is entirely possible to accommodate atural ventilation  and cooling in large buildings by looking into the past  before the widespread introduction of air conditioning systems  which were  relentlessly and aggressively marketed  by their inventors   C Short points out that to make most contemporary buildings habitable  they have to be sealed and air conditioned  The energy use and carbon emissions this generates is spectacular and largely unnecessary  Buildings in the West account for    of electricity usage  generating substantial carbon emissions  and the rest of the world is catching up at a frightening rate  Short regards glass  steel and air conditioned skyscrapers as symbols of status  rather than practical ways of meeting our requirements   D  Short s book highlights a developing and sophisticated art and science of ventilating buildings through the th and earlier th centuries  including the design of ingeniously ventilated hospitals  Of particular interest were those built to the designs of John Shaw Billings  including the first Johns Hopkins Hospital in the US city of Baltimore        We spent three years digitally modelling Billings  final designs   says Short   We put pathogens in the airstreams  modelled for someone with tuberculosis  TB  coughing in the wards and we found the ventilation systems in the room would have kept other patients safe from harm      pathogens  microorganisms that can cause disease  " "X Reading  E  We discovered that th century hospital wards could generate up to  air changes an hour   that s similar to the performance of a modern day  computer controlled operating theatre  We believe you could build wards based on these principles ow  Single rooms are ot appropriate for all patients  Communal wards appropriate for certain patients   older people with dementia  for example   would work just as well in today s hospitals  at a fraction of the energy cost    Professor Short contends the mindset and skill sets behind these designs have been completely lost  lamenting the disappearance of expertly designed theatres  opera houses  and other buildings where up to half the volume of the building was given over to ensuring everyone got fresh air   F Much of the ingenuity present in th century hospital and building design was driven by a panicked public clamouring for buildings that could protect against what was thought to be the lethal threat of miasmas   toxic air that spread disease  Miasmas were feared as the principal agents of disease and epidemics for centuries  and were used to explain the spread of infection from the Middle Ages right through to the cholera outbreaks in London and Paris during the s  Foul air  rather than germs  was believed to be the main driver of  hospital fever   leading to disease and frequent death  The prosperous steered clear of hospitals   While miasma theory has been long since disproved  Short has for the last  years advocated a return to some of the building design principles produced in its wake   G Today  huge amounts of a building s space and construction cost are given over to air conditioning   But   have designed and built a series of buildings over the past three decades which have tried to reinvent some of these ideas and then measure what happens    To go forward into our ew low energy  low carbon future  we would be well advised to look back at design before our high energy  high carbon present appeared  What is surprising is what a rich legacy we have abandoned    H Successful examples of Short s approach include the Queen s Building at De Montfort University in Leicester  Containing as many as   staff and students  the entire building is aturally ventilated  passively cooled and aturally lit  including the two largest auditoria  each seating more than  people  The award winning building uses a fraction of the electricity of comparable buildings in the UK   Short contends that glass skyscrapers in London and around the world will become a liability over the ext  or  years if climate modelling predictions and energy price rises come to pass as expected   I He is convinced that sufficiently cooled skyscrapers using the atural environment can be produced in almost any climate  He and his team have worked on hybrid buildings in the harsh climates of Beijing and Chicago   built with atural ventilation assisted by back up air conditioning   which  surprisingly perhaps  can be switched off more than half the time on milder days and during the spring and autumn   Short looks at how we might reimagine the cities  offices and homes of the future  Maybe it s time we

H   " "X Reading Why companies should welcome disorder  A   Organisation is big business  Whether it is of our lives   all those inboxes and calendars   or how companies are structured  a multi billion dollar industry helps to meet this eed  We have more strategies for time management  project management and self organisation than at any other time in human history  We are told that we ought to organise our company  our home life  our week  our day and even our sleep  all as a means to becoming more productive  Every week  countless seminars and workshops take place around the world to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in order to achieve this   This rhetoric has also crept into the thinking of business leaders and entrepreneurs  much to the delight of self proclaimed perfectionists with the eed to get everything right  The number of business schools and graduates has massively increased over the past  years  essentially teaching people how to organise well   B Ironically  however  the umber of businesses that fail has also steadily increased  Work related stress has increased  A large proportion of workers from all demographics claim to be dissatisfied with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed  This begs the question  what has gone wrong  Why is it that on paper the drive for organisation seems a sure shot for increasing productivity  but in reality falls well short of what is expected   C This has been a problem for a while ow  Frederick Taylor was one of the forefathers of scientific management  Writing in the first half of the th century  he designed a umber of principles to improve the efficiency of the work process  which have since become widespread in modern companies  So the approach has been around for a while   D New research suggests that this obsession with efficiency is misguided  The problem is ot necessarily the management theories or strategies we use to organise our work  it s the basic assumptions we hold in approaching how we work  Here it s the assumption that order is a necessary condition for productivity  This assumption has also fostered the idea that disorder must be detrimental to organisational productivity  The result is that businesses and people spend time and money organising themselves for the sake of organising  rather than actually looking at the end goal and usefulness of such an effort   E  What s more  recent studies show that order actually has diminishing returns  Order does increase productivity to a certain extent  but eventually the usefulness of the process of organisation  and the benefit it yields  reduce until the point where any further increase in order reduces productivity  Some argue that in a business  if the cost of formally structuring something outweighs the benefit of doing it  then that thing ought ot to be formally structured  Instead  the resources involved can be better used elsewhere     " "X i Test  Questions

everyone involved to engage as one organic group  These environments can lead to ew solutions that  under conventionally structured environments  filled with bottlenecks in terms of information flow  power structures  rules  and routines  would ever be reached   G  Inrecent times companies have slowly started to embrace this disorganisation  Many of them embrace it in terms of perception  embracing the idea of disorder  as opposed to fearing it  and in terms of process  putting mechanisms in place to reduce structure    For example  Oticon  a large Danish manufacturer of hearing aids  used what it called a  spaghetti  structure in order to reduce the organisation s rigid hierarchies  This involved scrapping formal job titles and giving staff huge amounts of ownership over their own time and projects  This approach proved to be highly successful initially  with clear improvements in worker productivity in all facets of the business   In similar fashion  the former chairman of General Electric embraced disorganisation  putting forward the idea of the  boundaryless  organisation  Again  it involves breaking down the barriers between different parts of a company and encouraging virtual collaboration and flexible working  Google and a umber of other tech companies have embraced  at least in part  these kinds of flexible structures  facilitated by technology and strong company values which glue people together   H A word of warning to others thinking of jumping on this bandwagon  the evidence so far suggests disorder  much like order  also seems to have diminishing utility  and can also have detrimental effects on performance if overused  Like order  disorder should be embraced only so far as it is useful  But we should ot fear it   or venerate one over the other   This research also shows that we should continually question whether or ot our existing assumptions work    " "X Reading Questions   Complete the sentences below  Choose ONE WORD ONLY

Reading READING  READING PASSAGE   You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading  Passage  below   The concept of intelligence  A  Looked at in one way  everyone knows what intelligence is  looked at in another way  o one does  In other words  people all have unconscious otions   known as  implicit theories    of intelligence  but o one knows for certain what it actually is  This chapter addresses how people conceptualize intelligence  whatever it may actually be   But why should we even care what people think intelligence is  as opposed only to valuing whatever it actually is  There are at least four reasons people s conceptions of intelligence matter   B First  implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people perceive and evaluate their own intelligence and that of others  To better understand the judgments people make about their own and others  abilities  it is useful to learn about people s implicit theories   For example  parents  implicit theories of their children s language development will determine at what ages they will be willing to make various corrections in their children s speech  More generally  parents  implicit theories of intelligence will determine at what ages they believe their children are ready to perform various cognitive tasks  Job interviewers will make hiring decisions on the basis of their implicit theories of intelligence  People  will decide who to be friends with on the basis of such theories  In sum  knowledge about implicit theories of intelligence is important because this knowledge is so often used by people to make judgments in the course of their everyday lives   C Second  the implicit theories of scientific investigators ultimately give rise to their explicit theories  Thus it is useful to find out what these implicit theories are  Implicit theories provide a framework that is useful in defining the general scope of a phenomenon   especially a ot well understood phenomenon  These implicit theories can suggest what aspects of the phenomenon have been more or less attended to in previous investigations   D Third  implicit theories can be useful when an investigator suspects that existing explicit theories are wrong or misleading  If an investigation of implicit theories reveals little correspondence between the extant implicit and explicit theories  the implicit theories may be wrong  But the possibility also eeds to be taken into account that the explicit theories are wrong and in eed of correction or supplementation  For example  some implicit theories of intelligence suggest the eed for expansion of some of our explicit theories of the construct     " "X Test   E Finally  understanding implicit theories of intelligence can help elucidate developmental and cross cultural differences  As mentioned earlier  people have expectations for intellectual performances that differ for children of different ages  How these expectations differ is in part a function of culture  For example  expectations for children who participate in Western style schooling are almost certain to be different from those for children who do not participate in such schooling   F  have suggested that there are three major implicit theories of how intelligence relates to society as a whole  Sternberg     These might be called Hamiltonian  Jeffersonian  and Jacksonian  These views are ot based strictly  but rather  loosely  on the philosophies of Alexander Hamilton  Thomas Jefferson  and Andrew Jackson  three great statesmen in the history of the United States   G The Hamiltonian view  which is similar to the Platonic view  is that people are born with different levels of intelligence and that those who are less intelligent eed the good offices of the more intelligent to keep them in line  whether they are called government officials or  in Plato s term  philosopher kings  Herrnstein and Murray    seem to have shared this belief when they wrote about the emergence of a cognitive  high IQ  elite  which eventually would have to take responsibility for the largely irresponsible masses of on elite  low IQ  people who cannot take care of themselves  Left to themselves  the unintelligent would create  as they always have created  a kind of chaos   H The Jeffersonian view is that people should have equal opportunities  but they do ot necessarily avail themselves equally of these opportunities and are ot ecessarily equally rewarded for their accomplishments  People are rewarded for what they accomplish  if given equal opportunity  Low achievers are ot rewarded to the same extent as high achievers   In the Jeffersonian view  the goal of education is ot to favor or foster an elite  as in the Hamiltonian tradition  but rather to allow children the opportunities to make full use of the skills they have  My own views are similar to these  Sternberg      I The Jacksonian view is that all people are equal  ot only as human beings but in terms of their competencies   that one person would serve as well as another in government or on a jury or in almost any position of responsibility  In this view of democracy  people are essentially intersubstitutable except for specialized skills  all of which can be learned  In this view  we do ot eed or want any institutions that might lead to favoring one group over another   J Implicit theories of intelligence and of the relationship of intelligence to society perhaps need to be considered more carefully than they have been because they often serve as underlying presuppositions for explicit theories and even experimental designs that are then taken as scientific contributions  Until scholars are able to discuss their implicit theories and thus their assumptions  they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when discussing their explicit theories and their data     " "X Reading Questions   Reading Passage

PASSAGE   You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading  Passage  below   Saving bugs to find ew drugs Zoologist Ross Piper looks at the potential of insects in pharmaceutical research  A More drugs than you might think are derived from  or inspired by  compounds found in living things  Looking to ature for the soothing and curing of our ailments is nothing ew   we have been doing it for tens of thousands of years  You only have to look at other primates   such as the capuchin monkeys who rub themselves with toxin oozing millipedes to deter mosquitoes  or the chimpanzees who use oxious forest plants to rid themselves of intestinal parasites   to realise that our ancient ancestors too probably had a basic grasp of medicine   B Pharmaceutical science and chemistry built on these ancient foundations and perfected the extraction  characterisation  modification and testing of these atural products  Then  for a while  modern pharmaceutical science moved its focus away from ature and into the laboratory  designing chemical compounds from scratch  The main cause of this shift is that although there are plenty of promising chemical compounds in ature  finding them is far from easy  Securing sufficient umbers of the organism in question  isolating and characterising the compounds of interest  and producing large quantities of these compounds are all significant hurdles   C  Laboratory based drug discovery has achieved varying levels of success  something which has ow prompted the development of ew approaches focusing once again on atural products  With the ability to mine genomes for useful compounds  it is ow evident that we have barely scratched the surface of ature s molecular diversity  This realisation  together with several looming health crises  such as antibiotic resistance  has put bioprospecting   the search for useful compounds in ature   firmly back on the map   D Insects are the undisputed masters of the terrestrial domain  where they occupy every possible iche  Consequently  they have a bewildering array of interactions with other organisms  something which has driven the evolution of an enormous range of very interesting compounds for defensive and offensive purposes  Their remarkable diversity exceeds that of every other group of animals on the planet combined  Yet even though insects are far and away the most diverse animals in existence  their potential as sources of therapeutic compounds is yet to be realised     " "X Test   E From the tiny proportion of insects that have been investigated  several promising compounds have been identified  For example  alloferon  an antimicrobial compound produced by blow fly larvae  is used as an antiviral and antitumor agent in South Korea and Russia  The larvae of a few other insect species are being investigated for the potent antimicrobial compounds they produce  Meanwhile  a compound from the venom of the wasp Polybia paulista has potential in cancer treatment   F Why is it that insects have received relatively little attention in bioprospecting  Firstly  there are so many insects that  without some manner of targeted approach  investigating this huge variety of species is a daunting task  Secondly  insects are generally very small  and the glands inside them that secrete potentially useful compounds are smaller still  This can make it difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of the compound for subsequent testing  Thirdly  although we consider insects to be everywhere  the reality of this ubiquity is vast umbers of a few extremely common species  Many insect species are infrequently encountered and very difficult to rear in captivity  which  again  can leave us with insufficient material to work with   G My colleagues and   at Aberystwyth University in the UK have developed an approach in which we use our knowledge of ecology as a guide to target our efforts  The creatures that particularly interest us are the many insects that secrete powerful poison for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for future consumption  There are even more insects that are masters of exploiting filthy habitats  such as faeces and carcasses  where they are regularly challenged by thousands of micro  organisms  These insects have many antimicrobial compounds for dealing with pathogenic bacteria and fungi  suggesting that there is certainly potential to find many compounds that can serve as or inspire ew antibiotics   H  Although atural history knowledge points us in the right direction  it doesn t solve the problems associated with obtaining useful compounds from insects  Fortunately  it is ow possible to snip out the stretches of the insect s DNA that carry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that allow larger quantities to be produced  And although the road from isolating and characterising compounds with desirable qualities to developing a commercial product is very long and full of pitfalls  the variety of successful animal derived pharmaceuticals on the market demonstrates there is a precedent here that is  worth exploring     With every bit of wilderness that disappears  we deprive ourselves of potential medicines  As much as I d love to help develop a groundbreaking insect derived medicine  my main motivation for looking at insects in this way is conservation    sincerely believe that all species  however small and seemingly insignificant  have a right to exist for their own sake  If we can shine a light on the darker recesses of ature s medicine cabinet  exploring the useful chemistry of the most diverse animals on the planet    believe we can make people think differently about the value of ature     " "X Reading  Questions

the world over  plays  The drive to play is so intense that children will do so in any circumstances  for instance when they have o real toys  or when parents do ot actively encourage the behavior  In the eyes of a young child  running  pretending  and building are fun  Researchers and educators know that these playful activities benefit the development of the whole child across social  cognitive  physical  and emotional domains  Indeed  play is such an instrumental component to healthy child development that the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights    recognized play as a fundamental right of every child  Yet  while experts continue to expound a powerful argument for the importance of play in children s lives  the actual time children spend playing continues to decrease  Today  children play eight hours less each week than their counterparts did two decades ago  Elkind    Under pressure of rising academic standards  play is being replaced by test preparation in kindergartens and grade schools  and parents who aim to give their preschoolers a leg up are led to believe that flashcards and educational  toys  are the path to success  Our society has created a false dichotomy between play and learning  Through play  children learn to regulate their behavior  lay the foundations for later learning in science and mathematics  figure out the complex egotiations of social relationships  build a repertoire of creative problem solving skills  and so much more  There is also an important role for adults in guiding children through playful learning opportunities  Full consensus on a formal definition of play continues to elude the researchers and theorists who study it  Definitions range from discrete descriptions of various types of play such as physical  construction  language  or symbolic play  Miller   Almon    to lists of broad criteria  based on observations and attitudes  that are meant to capture the essence of all play behaviors  e g  Rubin et al     A majority of the contemporary definitions of play focus on several key criteria  The founder of the National Institute for Play  Stuart Brown  has described play as  anything that spontaneously is done for its own sake   More specifically  he says it  appears purposeless  produces pleasure and joy   and  leads one to the ext stage of mastery   as quoted in Tippett    Similarly  Miller and Almon    say that play includes  activities that are freely chosen and directed by children and arise from intrinsic motivation   Often  play is defined along a continuum as more or less playful using the following set of behavioral and dispositional criteria  e g  Rubin et al     Play is pleasurable  Children must enjoy the activity or it is ot play  It is intrinsically motivated  Children engage in play simply for the satisfaction the behavior itself brings  It has o extrinsically motivated function or goal  Play is process oriented  When children   " "X Test   Questions

 It is freely chosen  spontaneous and voluntary  Ifa child is pressured  they will likely ot think of the activity as play  Play is actively engaged  Players must be physically and or mentally involved in the activity  Play is on literal  It involves make believe  According to this view  children s playful behaviors can range in degree from   to   playful  Rubin and colleagues did ot assign greater weight to any one dimension in determining playfulness  however  other researchers have suggested that process orientation and a lack of obvious functional purpose may be the most important aspects of play  e g  Pellegrini    From the perspective of a continuum  play can thus blend with other motives and attitudes that are less playful  such as work  Unlike play  work is typically ot viewed as enjoyable and it is extrinsically motivated  i e  it is goal oriented   Researcher Joan Goodman    suggested that hybrid forms of work and play are ot a detriment to learning  rather  they can provide optimal contexts for learning  For example  a child may be engaged in a difficult  goal directed activity set up by their teacher  but they may still be actively engaged and intrinsically motivated  At this mid point between play and work  the child s motivation  coupled with guidance from an adult  can create robust opportunities for playful learning  Critically  recent research supports the idea that adults can facilitate children s learning while maintaining a playful approach in interactions known as  guided play   Fisher et al     The adult s role in play varies as a function of their educational goals and the child s developmental level  Hirsch Pasek et al     Guided play takes two forms  At a very basic level  adults can enrich the child s environment by providing objects or experiences that promote aspects of a curriculum  In the more direct form of guided play  parents or other adults can support children s play by joining in the fun as a co player  raising thoughtful questions  commenting on children s discoveries  or encouraging further exploration or ew facets to the child s activity  Although playful learning can be somewhat structured  it must also be child centered  Nicolopolou et al     Play should stem from the child s own desire  Both free and guided play are essential elements in a child centered approach to playful learning  Intrinsically motivated free play provides the child with true autonomy  while guided play is an avenue through which parents and educators can provide more targeted learning experiences  In either case  play should be actively engaged  it should be predominantly child directed  and it must be fun    " "X Reading Questions   Look at the following statements  Questions    and the list of

doesn t seem to show any signs of aging  Old worker ants can do everything just as well as the youngsters  and their brains appear just as sharp   We get a picture that these ants really don t decline   says Ysabel Giraldo  who studied the ants for her doctoral thesis at Boston University  Such age defying feats are rare in the animal kingdom  Naked mole rats can live for almost   years and stay fit for early their entire lives  They can still reproduce even when old  and they never get cancer  But the vast majority of animals deteriorate with age just like people do  Like the aked mole rat  ants are social creatures that usually live in highly organised colonies   It s this social complexity that makes P dentata useful for studying aging in people   says Giraldo  now at the California Institute of Technology  Humans are also highly social  a trait that has been connected to healthier aging  By contrast  most animal studies of aging use mice  worms or fruit flies  which all lead much more isolated lives   In the lab  P dentata worker ants typically live for around  days  Giraldo focused on ants  at four age ranges   to  days   to  days   to  days and  to  days  Unlike all previous studies  which only estimated how old the ants were  her work tracked the ants from the time the pupae became adults  so she knew their exact ages  Then she put them through a range of tests   Giraldo watched how well the ants took care of the young of the colony  recording how often each ant attended to  carried and fed them  She compared how well  day old and  day old ants followed the telltale scent that the insects usually leave to mark a trail to food  She tested how ants responded to light and also measured how active they were by counting how often ants in a small dish walked across a line  And she experimented with how ants react to live prey  a tethered fruit fly  Giraldo expected the older ants to perform poorly in all these tasks  But the elderly insects were all good caretakers and trail followers the  day old ants could track the scent even longer than their younger counterparts  They all responded to light well  and the older ants were more active  And when it came to reacting to prey  the older ants attacked the poor fruit fly just as aggressively as the young ones did  flaring their mandibles or pulling at the fly s legs  Then Giraldo compared the brains of  day old and  day old ants  identifying any cells that were close to death  She saw o major differences with age  or was there any difference in the location of the dying cells  showing that age didn t seem to affect specific brain functions  Ants and other insects have structures in their brains called mushroom bodies  which are important for   " "X Reading processing information  learning and memory  She also wanted to see if aging affects the density of synaptic complexes within these structures regions where eurons come together  Again  the answer was o  What was more  the old ants didn t experience any drop in the levels of either serotonin or dopamine brain chemicals whose decline often coincides with aging  In humans  for example  a decrease in serotonin has been linked to Alzheimer s disease    This is the first time anyone has looked at both behavioral and eural changes in these ants so thoroughly   says Giraldo  who recently published the findings in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B  Scientists have looked at some similar aspects in bees  but the results of recent bee studies were mixed some studies showed age related declines  which biologists call senescence  and others didn t   For ow  the study raises more questions than it answers   Giraldo says   including how P dentata stays in such good shape   Also  if the ants don t deteriorate with age  why do they die at all  Out in the wild  the ants probably don t live for a full  days thanks to predators  disease and just being in an environment that s much harsher than the comforts of the lab   The lucky ants that do live into old age may suffer a steep decline just before dying   Giraldo says  but she can t say for sure because her study wasn t designed to follow an ant s final moments   It will be important to extend these findings to other species of social insects   says Gene E  Robinson  an entomologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  This ant might be unique  or it might represent a broader pattern among other social bugs with possible clues to the science of aging in larger animals  Either way  it seems that for these ants  age really doesn t matter     " "X

Reading  Passage  below   Why zoos are good Scientist David Hone makes the case for zoos  A In my view  it is perfectly possible for many species of animals living in zoos or wildlife parks to have a quality of life as high as  or higher than  in the wild  Animals in good zoos get a varied and high quality diet with all the supplements required  and any illnesses they might have will be treated  Their movement might be somewhat restricted  but they have a safe environment in which to live  and they are spared bullying and social ostracism by others of their kind  They do ot suffer from the threat or stress of predators  or the irritation and pain of parasites or injuries  The average captive animal will have a greater life expectancy compared with its wild counterpart  and will ot die of drought  of starvation or in the jaws of a predator  A lot of very asty things happen to truly  wild  animals that simply don t happen in good zoos  and to view a life that is  free  as one that is automatically  good  is    think  an error  Furthermore  zoos serve several key purposes   B Firstly  zoos aid conservation  Colossal umbers of species are becoming extinct across the world  and many more are increasingly threatened and therefore risk extinction  Moreover  some of these collapses have been sudden  dramatic and unexpected  or were simply discovered very late in the day  A species protected in captivity can be bred up to provide a reservoir population against a population crash or extinction in the wild  A good umber of species only exist in captivity  with many of these living in zoos  Still more only exist in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos  or have wild populations that have been boosted by captive bred animals  Without these efforts there would be fewer species alive today  Although reintroduction successes are few and far between  the umbers are increasing  and the very fact that species have been saved or reintroduced as a result of captive breeding proves the value of such initiatives   C Zoos also provide education  Many children and adults  especially those in cities  will ever see a wild animal beyond a fox or pigeon  While it is true that television documentaries are becoming ever more detailed and impressive  and many natural history specimens are on display in museums  there really is othing to compare with seeing a living creature in the flesh  hearing it  smelling it  watching what it does and having the time to absorb details  That alone will bring a greater understanding and perspective to many  and hopefully give them a greater appreciation for wildlife  conservation efforts and how they can contribute     " "X Reading  D In addition to this  there is also the education that can take place in zoos through signs  talks and presentations which directly communicate information to visitors about the animals they are seeing and their place in the world  This was an area where zoos used to be lacking  but they are ow increasingly sophisticated in their communication and outreach work  Many zoos also work directly to educate conservation workers in other countries  or send their animal keepers abroad to contribute their knowledge and skills to those working in zoos and reserves  thereby helping to improve conditions and reintroductions all over the world   E Zoos also play a key role in research  If we are to save wild species and restore and repair ecosystems we eed to know about how key species live  act and react  Being able to undertake research on animals in zoos where there is less risk and fewer variables means real changes can be effected on wild populations  Finding out about  for example  the oestrus cycle of an animal or its breeding rate helps us manage wild populations  Procedures such as capturing and moving at risk or dangerous individuals are bolstered by knowledge gained in zoos about doses for anaesthetics  and by experience in handling and transporting animals  This can make a real difference to conservation efforts and to the reduction of human animal conflicts  and can provide a knowledge base for helping with the increasing threats of habitat destruction and other problems   F  Inconclusion  considering the many ongoing global threats to the environment  it is hard for me to see zoos as anything other than essential to the long term survival of umerous species  They are vital ot just in terms of protecting animals  but as a means of learning about them to aid those still in the wild  as well as educating and informing the general population about these animals and their world so that they can assist or at least accept the eed to be more environmentally conscious  Without them  the world would be  and would increasingly become  a much poorer place

is building a magical kingdom  Imagining fairy tale turrets and fire breathing dragons  wicked witches and gallant heroes  she s creating an enchanting world  Although she isn t aware of it  this fantasy is helping her take her first steps towards her capacity for creativity and so it will have important repercussions in her adult life   Minutes later  Alice has abandoned the kingdom in favour of playing schools with her younger brother  When she bosses him around as his  teacher   she s practising how to regulate her emotions through pretence  Later on  when they tire of this and settle down with a board game  she s learning about the eed to follow rules and take turns with a partner    Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of the human species   says  Dr David Whitebread from the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge  UK   It underpins how we develop as intellectual  problem solving adults and is crucial to our success as  a highly adaptable species    Recognising the importance of play is ot ew  over two millennia ago  the Greek philosopher Plato extolled its virtues as a means of developing skills for adult life  and ideas about play based learning have been developing since the th century   But we live in changing times  and Whitebread is mindful of a worldwide decline in play  pointing out that over half the people in the world ow live in cities   The opportunities for free play  which I experienced almost every day of my childhood  are becoming increasingly scarce   he says  Outdoor play is curtailed by perceptions of risk to do with traffic  as well as parents  increased wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime  and by the emphasis on  earlier is better  which is leading to greater competition in academic learning and schools  International bodies like the United Nations and the European Union have begun to develop policies concerned with children s right to play  and to consider implications for leisure facilities and educational programmes  But what they often lack is the evidence to base policies on    The type of play we are interested in is child initiated

ecologist at the University of California  Davis  has been trying to answer a dismal question  Is everything terrible  or are things just very  very bad  Rochman is a member of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis s marine debris working group  a collection of scientists who study  among other things  the growing problem of marine debris  also known as ocean trash  Plenty of studies have sounded alarm bells about the state of marine debris  in a recent paper published in the journal Ecology  Rochman and her colleagues set out to determine how many of those perceived risks are real  Often  Rochman says  scientists will end a paper by speculating about the broader impacts of what they ve found  For example  a study could show that certain seabirds eat plastic bags  and go on to warn that whole bird populations are at risk of dying out   But the truth was that obody had yet tested those perceived threats   Rochman says   There wasn t a lot of information   Rochman and her colleagues examined more than a hundred papers on the impacts of marine debris that were published through   Within each paper  they asked what threats scientists had studied    perceived threats in all   and what they d actually found  In  percent of cases  the perceived dangers of ocean trash were proven true  In the remaining cases  the working group found the studies had weaknesses in design and content which affected the validity of their conclusions   they lacked a control group  for example  or used faulty statistics  Strikingly  Rochman says  only one well designed study failed to find the effect it was looking for  an investigation of mussels ingesting microscopic plastic bits  The plastic moved from the mussels  stomachs to their bloodstreams  scientists found  and stayed there for weeks   but didn t seem to stress out the shellfish  While mussels may be fine eating trash  though  the analysis also gave a clearer picture of the many ways that ocean debris is bothersome  Within the studies they looked at  most of the proven threats came from plastic debris  rather than other materials like metal or wood  Most of the dangers also involved large pieces of debris   animals getting entangled in trash  for example  or eating it and severely injuring themselves  But a lot of ocean debris is  microplastic   or pieces smaller than five millimeters  These may be ingredients used in cosmetics and toiletries  fibers shed by synthetic clothing in the wash  or eroded remnants of larger debris  Compared to the umber of studies investigating large scale debris  Rochman s group found little research on the effects of these tiny bits   There are a lot of open questions still for microplastic   Rochman says  though she otes that more papers on the subject have been published since   the cutoff point for the group s analysis    " "X Reading There are also  she adds  a lot of open questions about the ways that ocean debris can lead to sea creature death  Many studies have looked at how plastic affects an individual animal  or that animal s tissues or cells  rather than whole populations  And in the lab  scientists often use higher concentrations of plastic than what s really in the ocean  None of that tells us how many birds or fish or sea turtles could die from plastic pollution   or how deaths in one species could affect that animal s predators  or the rest of the ecosystem   We eed to be asking more ecologically relevant questions   Rochman says  Usually  scientists don t know exactly how disasters such as a tanker accidentally spilling its whole cargo of oil and polluting huge areas of the ocean will affect the environment until after they ve happened   We don t ask the right questions early enough   she says  But if ecologists can understand how the slow moving effect of ocean trash is damaging ecosystems  they might be able to prevent things from getting worse  Asking the right questions can help policy makers  and the public

a recent paper used simulations to show that strategically positioning the cleanup devices closer to shore would more effectively reduce pollution over the long term   I think clearing up some of these misperceptions is really important   Rochman says  Among scientists as well as in the media  she says   A lot of the images about strandings and entanglement and all of that cause the perception

the steps in the puzzle of how and why play is important have been looked at  there is very little data on the impact it has on the child s later life  Now  thanks to the university s ew Centre for Research on Play in Education  Development and Learning  PEDAL   Whitebread  Baker  Gibson and a team of researchers hope to provide evidence on the role played by play in how a child develops   A strong possibility is that play supports the early development of children s self control   explains Baker   This is our ability to develop awareness of our own thinking processes   it influences how effectively we go about undertaking challenging activities   Ina study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young pre schoolers  she found that children with greater self control solved problems more quickly when exploring an unfamiliar set up requiring scientific reasoning   This sort of evidence makes us think that giving children the chance to play will make them more successful problem solvers in the long run   If playful experiences do facilitate this aspect of development  say the researchers  it could be extremely significant for educational practices  because the ability to self regulate has been shown to be a key predictor of academic performance  Gibson adds   Playful behaviour is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional development  In my previous research  I investigated how observing children at play can give us important clues about their well being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism   Whitebread s recent research has involved developing a play based approach to supporting children s writing   Many primary school children find writing difficult  but we showed in a previous study that a playful stimulus was far more effective than an instructional one   Children wrote longer and better structured stories when they first played with dolls representing characters in the story  In the latest study  children first created their story with Lego   with similar results   Many teachers commented that they had always previously had children saying they didn t know what to write about  With the Lego building  however  ot a single child said this through the whole year of the project   Whitebread  who directs PEDAL  trained as a primary school teacher in the early s  when  as he describes   the teaching of young children was largely a quiet backwater  untroubled by any serious intellectual debate or controversy   Now  the landscape is very different  with hotly debated topics such as school starting age   Somehow the importance of play has been lost in recent decades  It s regarded as something trivial  or even as something egative that contrasts with  work   Let s ot lose sight of its benefits  and the fundamental contributions it makes to human achievements in the arts  sciences and technology  Let s make sure children have a rich diet of play experiences

Passage  below 
The growth of bike-sharing schemes around
the world
How Dutch engineer Luud Schimmelpennink helped to devise urban
bike-sharing schemes

A The original idea for an urban bike-sharing scheme dates back to a summer's day
in Amsterdam in   Provo, the organisation that came up with the idea, was a
group of Dutch activists who wanted to change society  They believed the scheme,
which was known as the Witte Fietsenplan, was an answer to the perceived threats
of air pollution and consumerism  In the centre of Amsterdam, they painted a small
number of used bikes white  They also distributed leaflets describing the dangers of
cars and inviting people to use the white bikes  The bikes were then left unlocked at
various locations around the city, to be used by anyone in need of transport 

B Luud Schimmelpennink, a Dutch industrial engineer who still lives and cycles
in Amsterdam, was heavily involved in the original scheme  He recalls how the
scheme succeeded in attracting a great deal of attention � particularly when it
came to publicising Provo�s aims � but struggled to get off the ground  The police
were opposed to Provo�s initiatives and almost as soon as the white bikes were
distributed around the city, they removed them  However, for Schimmelpennink and
for bike-sharing schemes in general, this was just the beginning  �The first Witte
Fietsenplan was just a symbolic thing,� he says  �We painted a few bikes white, that
was all  Things got more serious when | became a member of the Amsterdam city
council two years later �

C � Schimmelpennink seized this opportunity to present a more elaborate Witte
Fietsenplan to the city council  �My idea was that the municipality of Amsterdam
would distribute , white bikes over the city, for everyone to use,� he explains 
�I made serious calculations  It turned out that a white bicycle � per person, per
kilometre � would cost the municipality only % of what it contributed to public
transport per person per kilometre � Nevertheless, the council unanimously rejected
the plan  �They said that the bicycle belongs to the past  They saw a glorious future
for the car,� says Schimmelpennink  But he was not in the least discouraged 

D� Schimmelpennink never stopped believing in bike-sharing, and in the mid-s,
two Danes asked for his help to set up a system in Copenhagen  The result was
the world�s first large-scale bike-share programme  It worked on a deposit: �You
dropped a coin in the bike and when you returned it, you got your money back �
After setting up the Danish system, Schimmelpennink decided to try his luck again


" "Reading
in the Netherlands � and this time he succeeded in arousing the interest of the
Dutch Ministry of Transport  �Times had changed,� he recalls  �People had become
more environmentally conscious, and the Danish experiment had proved that
bike-sharing was a real possibility � A new Witte Fietsenplan was launched in 
in Amsterdam  However, riding a white bike was no longer free; it cost one guilder
per trip and payment was made with a chip card developed by the Dutch bank
Postbank  Schimmelpennink designed conspicuous, sturdy white bikes locked
in special racks which could be opened with the chip card � the plan started with
 bikes, distributed over five stations 

E Theo Molenaar, who was a system designer for the project, worked alongside
Schimmelpennink  �| remember when we were testing the bike racks, he announced
that he had already designed better ones  But of course, we had to go through with
the ones we had � The system, however, was prone to vandalism and theft  �After
every weekend there would always be a couple of bikes missing,� Molenaar says 

�| really have no idea what people did with them, because they could instantly be
recognised as white bikes � But the biggest blow came when Postbank decided to
abolish the chip card, because it wasn�t profitable  �That chip card was pivotal to the
system,� Molenaar says  �To continue the project we would have needed to set up
another system, but the business partner had lost interest �

F � Schimmelpennink was disappointed, but � characteristically � not for long  In 
he got a call from the French advertising corporation JC Decaux, who wanted to set
up his bike-sharing scheme in Vienna  �That went really well  After Vienna, they set
up a system in Lyon  Then in , Paris followed  That was a decisive moment in
the history of bike-sharing � The huge and unexpected success of the Parisian
bike-sharing programme, which now boasts more than , bicycles, inspired cities
all over the world to set up their own schemes, all modelled on Schimmelpennink�s 
�It's wonderful that this happened,� he says  �But financially | didn�t really benefit from
it, because | never filed for a patent �

GInAmsterdam today, % of all trips are made by bike and, along with
Copenhagen, it is regarded as one of the two most cycle-friendly capitals in the
world � but the city never got another Witte Fietsenplan  Molenaar believes this
may be because everybody in Amsterdam already has a bike  Schimmelpennink,
however, cannot see that this changes Amsterdam�s need for a bike-sharing
scheme  �People who travel on the underground don�t carry their bikes around 

But often they need additional transport to reach their final destination � Although
he thinks it is strange that a city like Amsterdam does not have a successful bike-
sharing scheme, he is optimistic about the future  �In the s we didn�t stand a
chance because people were prepared to give their lives to keep cars in the city 
But that mentality has totally changed  Today everybody longs for cities that are not
dominated by cars �

Passage  below 
Motivational factors and the hospitality industry
A critical ingredient in the success of hotels is developing and maintaining superior performance
from their employees  How is that accomplished? What Human Resource Management (HRM)
practices should organizations invest in to acquire and retain great employees?
Some hotels aim to provide superior working conditions for their employees  The idea originated
from workplaces � usually in the non-service sector � that emphasized fun and enjoyment as
part of work-life balance  By contrast, the service sector, and more specifically hotels, has
traditionally not extended these practices to address basic employee needs, such as good
working conditions 
Pfeffer () emphasizes that in order to succeed in a global business environment,
organizations must make investment in Human Resource Management (HRM) to allow them
to acquire employees who possess better skills and capabilities than their competitors  This
investment will be to their competitive advantage  Despite this recognition of the importance
of employee development, the hospitality industry has historically been dominated by
underdeveloped HR practices (Lucas, ) 
Lucas also points out that �the substance of HRM practices does not appear to be designed to
foster constructive relations with employees or to represent a managerial approach that enables
developing and drawing out the full potential of people, even though employees may be broadly
satisfied with many aspects of their work� (Lucas, )  In addition, or maybe as a result, high
employee turnover has been a recurring problem throughout the hospitality industry  Among
the many cited reasons are low compensation, inadequate benefits, poor working conditions and
compromised employee morale and attitudes (Maroudas et al , ) 
Ng and Sorensen () demonstrated that when managers provide recognition to employees,
motivate employees to work together, and remove obstacles preventing effective performance,
employees feel more obligated to stay with the company  This was succinctly summarized by
Michel et al  (): �[P]roviding support to employees gives them the confidence to perform
their jobs better and the motivation to stay with the organization � Hospitality organizations can
therefore enhance employee motivation and retention through the development and improvement
of their working conditions  These conditions are inherently linked to the working environment 
While it seems likely that employees� reactions to their job characteristics could be affected
by a predisposition to view their work environment negatively, no evidence exists to support
this hypothesis (Spector et al , )  However, given the opportunity, many people will find

" "Test 

something to complain about in relation to their workplace (Poulston, )  There is a strong

link between the perceptions of employees and particular factors of their work environment that
are separate from the work itself, including company policies, salary and vacations 

Such conditions are particularly troubling for the luxury hotel market, where high-quality service,
requiring a sophisticated approach to HRM, is recognized as a critical source of competitive
advantage (Maroudas et al , )  In a real sense, the services of hotel employees represent
their industry (Schneider and Bowen, )  This representation has commonly been limited to
guest experiences  This suggests that there has been a dichotomy between the guest environment
provided in luxury hotels and the working conditions of their employees 

It is therefore essential for hotel management to develop HRM practices that enable them to
inspire and retain competent employees  This requires an understanding of what motivates
employees at different levels of management and different stages of their careers (Enz and Siguaw,
)  This implies that it is beneficial for hotel managers to understand what practices are most
favorable to increase employee satisfaction and retention 

Herzberg () proposes that people have two major types of needs, the first being extrinsic
motivation factors relating to the context in which work is performed, rather than the work

itself  These include working conditions and job security  When these factors are unfavorable,
job dissatisfaction may result  Significantly, though, just fulfilling these needs does not result in
satisfaction, but only in the reduction of dissatisfaction (Maroudas et al , ) 

Employees also have intrinsic motivation needs or motivators, which include such factors as
achievement and recognition  Unlike extrinsic factors, motivator factors may ideally result in job
satisfaction (Maroudas et al , )  Herzberg�s () theory discusses the need for a �balance�
of these two types of needs 

The impact of fun as a motivating factor at work has also been explored  For example, Tews,
Michel and Stafford () conducted a study focusing on staff from a chain of themed restaurants
in the United States  It was found that fun activities had a favorable impact on performance and
manager support for fun had a favorable impact in reducing turnover  Their findings support the
view that fun may indeed have a beneficial effect, but the framing of that fun must be carefully
aligned with both organizational goals and employee characteristics  �Managers must learn how to
achieve the delicate balance of allowing employees the freedom to enjoy themselves at work while
simultaneously maintaining high levels of performance� (Tews et al , ) 

Deery () has recommended several actions that can be adopted at the organizational level to
retain good staff as well as assist in balancing work and family life  Those particularly appropriate
to the hospitality industry include allowing adequate breaks during the working day, staff
functions that involve families, and providing health and well-being opportunities

Passage  below 

Alexander Henderson (-)
Born in Scotland, Henderson emigrated to Canada in  and became a
well-known landscape photographer

Alexander Henderson was born in Scotland in  and was the son of a successful merchant 
His grandfather, also called Alexander, had founded the family business, and later became

the first chairman of the National Bank of Scotland  The family had extensive landholdings in
Scotland  Besides its residence in Edinburgh, it owned Press Estate,  acres of farmland about
 miles southeast of the city  The family often stayed at Press Castle, the large mansion on the
northern edge of the property, and Alexander spent much of his childhood in the area, playing on
the beach near Eyemouth or fishing in the streams nearby 

Even after he went to school at Murcheston Academy on the outskirts of Edinburgh, Henderson
returned to Press at weekends  In  he began a three-year apprenticeship to become an
accountant  Although he never liked the prospect of a business career, he stayed with it to

please his family  In October , however, he emigrated to Canada with his wife Agnes Elder
Robertson and they settled in Montreal 

Henderson learned photography in Montreal around the year  and quickly took it up

as a serious amateur  He became a personal friend and colleague of the Scottish-Canadian
photographer William Notman  The two men made a photographic excursion to Niagara Falls in
 and they cooperated on experiments with magnesium flares as a source of artificial light
in   They belonged to the same societies and were among the founding members of the Art
Association of Montreal  Henderson acted as chairman of the association�s first meeting, which
was held in Notman�s studio on  January  
In spite of their friendship, their styles of photography were quite different  While Notman�s
landscapes were noted for their bold realism, Henderson for the first  years of his career
produced romantic images, showing the strong influence of the British landscape tradition  His
artistic and technical progress was rapid and in  he published his first major collection of
landscape photographs  The publication had limited circulation (only seven copies have ever been
found), and was called Canadian Views and Studies  The contents of each copy vary significantly
and have proved a useful source for evaluating Henderson�s early work

In , he gave up his business to open a photographic studio, advertising himself as a portrait
and landscape photographer  From about  he dropped portraiture to specialize in landscape
photography and other views  His numerous photographs of city life revealed in street scenes,
houses, and markets are alive with human activity, and although his favourite subject was
landscape he usually composed his scenes around such human pursuits as farming the land,
cutting ice on a river, or sailing down a woodland stream  There was sufficient demand for these
types of scenes and others he took depicting the lumber trade, steamboats and waterfalls to enable
him to make a living  There was little competing hobby or amateur photography before the late
s because of the time-consuming techniques involved and the weight of the equipment 
People wanted to buy photographs as souvenirs of a trip or as gifts, and catering to this market,
Henderson had stock photographs on display at his studio for mounting, framing, or inclusion
in albums 
Henderson frequently exhibited his photographs in Montreal and abroad, in London, Edinburgh,
Dublin, Paris, New York, and Philadelphia  He met with greater success in  and  in
New York when he won first prizes in the exhibition held by E and H T Anthony and Company
for landscapes using the Lambertype process  In  his work won second prize at the world
exhibition in Paris 
In the s and s Henderson travelled widely throughout Quebec and Ontario, in Canada,
documenting the major cities of the two provinces and many of the villages in Quebec  He was
especially fond of the wilderness and often travelled by canoe on the Blanche, du Li�vre, and
other noted eastern rivers  He went on several occasions to the Maritimes and in  he sailed
by yacht along the lower north shore of the St Lawrence River  That same year, while in the lower
St Lawrence River region, he took some photographs of the construction of the Intercolonial
Railway  This undertaking led in  to a commission from the railway to record the principal
structures along the almost-completed line connecting Montreal to Halifax  Commissions from
other railways followed  In  he photographed bridges on the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and
Occidental Railway between Montreal and Ottawa  In  he went west along the Canadian
Pacific Railway (CPR) as far as Rogers Pass in British Columbia, where he took photographs of
the mountains and the progress of construction 
In  Henderson accepted a full-time position with the CPR as manager of a photographic
department which he was to set up and administer  His duties included spending four months
in the field each year  That summer he made his second trip west, photographing extensively
along the railway line as far as Victoria  He continued in this post until , when he retired
completely from photography 
When Henderson died in , his huge collection of glass negatives was stored in the basement
of his house  Today collections of his work are held at the National Archives of Canada, Ottawa,
and the McCord Museum of Canadian History, Montreal

Passage  below 
Back to the future of skyscraper design
Answers to the problem of excessive electricity use by skyscrapers
and large public buildings can be found in ingenious but forgotten
architectural designs of the th and early-th centuries

A The Recovery of Natural Environments in Architecture by Professor Alan Short is
the culmination of  years of research and award-winning green building design
by Short and colleagues in Architecture, Engineering, Applied Maths and Earth
Sciences at the University of Cambridge 

�The crisis in building design is already here,� said Short  �Policy makers think

you can solve energy and building problems with gadgets  You can�t  As global
temperatures continue to rise, we are going to continue to squander more and more
energy on keeping our buildings mechanically cool until we have run out of capacity �

B Short is calling for a sweeping reinvention of how skyscrapers and major public
buildings are designed � to end the reliance on sealed buildings which exist solely
via the �life support� system of vast air conditioning units 

Instead, he shows it is entirely possible to accommodate natural ventilation

and cooling in large buildings by looking into the past, before the widespread
introduction of air conditioning systems, which were �relentlessly and aggressively
marketed� by their inventors 

C Short points out that to make most contemporary buildings habitable, they have
to be sealed and air conditioned  The energy use and carbon emissions this
generates is spectacular and largely unnecessary  Buildings in the West account for
-% of electricity usage, generating substantial carbon emissions, and the rest
of the world is catching up at a frightening rate  Short regards glass, steel and
air-conditioned skyscrapers as symbols of status, rather than practical ways of
meeting our requirements 

D� Short�s book highlights a developing and sophisticated art and science of ventilating
buildings through the th and earlier-th centuries, including the design of
ingeniously ventilated hospitals  Of particular interest were those built to the
designs of John Shaw Billings, including the first Johns Hopkins Hospital in the US
city of Baltimore (-) 

�We spent three years digitally modelling Billings� final designs,� says Short  �We
put pathogens in the airstreams, modelled for someone with tuberculosis (TB)
coughing in the wards and we found the ventilation systems in the room would
have kept other patients safe from harm 

 * pathogens: microorganisms that can cause disease
" "Reading

E �We discovered that th-century hospital wards could generate up to  air changes
an hour � that�s similar to the performance of a modern-day, computer-controlled
operating theatre  We believe you could build wards based on these principles now 
Single rooms are not appropriate for all patients  Communal wards appropriate for
certain patients � older people with dementia, for example � would work just as well
in today�s hospitals, at a fraction of the energy cost �

Professor Short contends the mindset and skill-sets behind these designs have
been completely lost, lamenting the disappearance of expertly designed theatres,
opera houses, and other buildings where up to half the volume of the building was
given over to ensuring everyone got fresh air 

F Much of the ingenuity present in th-century hospital and building design was
driven by a panicked public clamouring for buildings that could protect against
what was thought to be the lethal threat of miasmas � toxic air that spread disease 
Miasmas were feared as the principal agents of disease and epidemics for
centuries, and were used to explain the spread of infection from the Middle Ages
right through to the cholera outbreaks in London and Paris during the s  Foul
air, rather than germs, was believed to be the main driver of �hospital fever�, leading
to disease and frequent death  The prosperous steered clear of hospitals 

While miasma theory has been long since disproved, Short has for the last  years
advocated a return to some of the building design principles produced in its wake 

G Today, huge amounts of a building�s space and construction cost are given over to
air conditioning  �But | have designed and built a series of buildings over the past
three decades which have tried to reinvent some of these ideas and then measure
what happens 

�To go forward into our new low-energy, low-carbon future, we would be well
advised to look back at design before our high-energy, high-carbon present
appeared  What is surprising is what a rich legacy we have abandoned �

H Successful examples of Short�s approach include the Queen�s Building at De
Montfort University in Leicester  Containing as many as , staff and students,
the entire building is naturally ventilated, passively cooled and naturally lit, including
the two largest auditoria, each seating more than  people  The award-winning
building uses a fraction of the electricity of comparable buildings in the UK 

Short contends that glass skyscrapers in London and around the world will become
a liability over the next  or  years if climate modelling predictions and energy
price rises come to pass as expected 

I He is convinced that sufficiently cooled skyscrapers using the natural environment
can be produced in almost any climate  He and his team have worked on hybrid
buildings in the harsh climates of Beijing and Chicago � built with natural ventilation
assisted by back-up air conditioning � which, surprisingly perhaps, can be switched
off more than half the time on milder days and during the spring and autumn 

Short looks at how we might reimagine the cities, offices and homes of the future 
Maybe it�s time we changed our outlook

Why companies should welcome disorder

A   Organisation is big business  Whether it is of our lives � all those inboxes and calendars �
or how companies are structured, a multi-billion dollar industry helps to meet this need 
We have more strategies for time management, project management and
self-organisation than at any other time in human history  We are told that we ought to
organise our company, our home life, our week, our day and even our sleep, all as a means
to becoming more productive  Every week, countless seminars and workshops take place
around the world to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in order to
achieve this 

This rhetoric has also crept into the thinking of business leaders and entrepreneurs, much
to the delight of self-proclaimed perfectionists with the need to get everything right  The
number of business schools and graduates has massively increased over the past  years,
essentially teaching people how to organise well 

B Ironically, however, the number of businesses that fail has also steadily increased 
Work-related stress has increased  A large proportion of workers from all demographics
claim to be dissatisfied with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed 
This begs the question: what has gone wrong? Why is it that on paper the drive for
organisation seems a sure shot for increasing productivity, but in reality falls well short of
what is expected?

C This has been a problem for a while now  Frederick Taylor was one of the forefathers of
scientific management  Writing in the first half of the th century, he designed a number
of principles to improve the efficiency of the work process, which have since become
widespread in modern companies  So the approach has been around for a while 

D New research suggests that this obsession with efficiency is misguided  The problem is not
necessarily the management theories or strategies we use to organise our work; it�s the basic
assumptions we hold in approaching how we work  Here it�s the assumption that order is a
necessary condition for productivity  This assumption has also fostered the idea that disorder
must be detrimental to organisational productivity  The result is that businesses and people
spend time and money organising themselves for the sake of organising, rather than actually
looking at the end goal and usefulness of such an effort 

E  What�s more, recent studies show that order actually has diminishing returns  Order does
increase productivity to a certain extent, but eventually the usefulness of the process of
organisation, and the benefit it yields, reduce until the point where any further increase in
order reduces productivity  Some argue that in a business, if the cost of formally structuring
something outweighs the benefit of doing it, then that thing ought not to be formally
structured  Instead, the resources involved can be better used elsewhere

F In fact, research shows that, when innovating, the best approach is to create an environment
devoid of structure and hierarchy and enable everyone involved to engage as one organic
group  These environments can lead to new solutions that, under conventionally structured
environments (filled with bottlenecks in terms of information flow, power structures, rules,
and routines) would never be reached 

G  Inrecent times companies have slowly started to embrace this disorganisation  Many of
them embrace it in terms of perception (embracing the idea of disorder, as opposed to
fearing it) and in terms of process (putting mechanisms in place to reduce structure) 

For example, Oticon, a large Danish manufacturer of hearing aids, used what it called a
�spaghetti� structure in order to reduce the organisation�s rigid hierarchies  This involved
scrapping formal job titles and giving staff huge amounts of ownership over their own time
and projects  This approach proved to be highly successful initially, with clear improvements
in worker productivity in all facets of the business 

In similar fashion, the former chairman of General Electric embraced disorganisation,
putting forward the idea of the �boundaryless� organisation  Again, it involves breaking
down the barriers between different parts of a company and encouraging virtual
collaboration and flexible working  Google and a number of other tech companies have
embraced (at least in part) these kinds of flexible structures, facilitated by technology and
strong company values which glue people together 

H A word of warning to others thinking of jumping on this bandwagon: the evidence so far
suggests disorder, much like order, also seems to have diminishing utility, and can also have
detrimental effects on performance if overused  Like order, disorder should be embraced
only so far as it is useful  But we should not fear it � nor venerate one over the other 

This research also shows that we should continually question whether or not our existing
assumptions work

You should spend about  minutes on Questions -, which are based on Reading

Passage  below 

The concept of intelligence

A  Looked at in one way, everyone knows what intelligence is; looked at in another way, no one
does  In other words, people all have unconscious notions � known as �implicit theories� �
of intelligence, but no one knows for certain what it actually is  This chapter addresses how
people conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may actually be 

But why should we even care what people think intelligence is, as opposed only to valuing
whatever it actually is? There are at least four reasons people�s conceptions of intelligence
matter 

B First, implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people perceive and evaluate
their own intelligence and that of others  To better understand the judgments people make
about their own and others� abilities, it is useful to learn about people�s implicit theories 

For example, parents� implicit theories of their children�s language development will
determine at what ages they will be willing to make various corrections in their children�s
speech  More generally, parents� implicit theories of intelligence will determine at what ages
they believe their children are ready to perform various cognitive tasks  Job interviewers
will make hiring decisions on the basis of their implicit theories of intelligence  People

will decide who to be friends with on the basis of such theories  In sum, knowledge about
implicit theories of intelligence is important because this knowledge is so often used by
people to make judgments in the course of their everyday lives 

C Second, the implicit theories of scientific investigators ultimately give rise to their explicit
theories  Thus it is useful to find out what these implicit theories are  Implicit theories
provide a framework that is useful in defining the general scope of a phenomenon �
especially a not-well-understood phenomenon  These implicit theories can suggest what
aspects of the phenomenon have been more or less attended to in previous investigations 

D Third, implicit theories can be useful when an investigator suspects that existing explicit
theories are wrong or misleading  If an investigation of implicit theories reveals little
correspondence between the extant implicit and explicit theories, the implicit theories may
be wrong  But the possibility also needs to be taken into account that the explicit theories
are wrong and in need of correction or supplementation  For example, some implicit
theories of intelligence suggest the need for expansion of some of our explicit theories of
the construct 


" "Test 

E Finally, understanding implicit theories of intelligence can help elucidate developmental and
cross-cultural differences  As mentioned earlier, people have expectations for intellectual
performances that differ for children of different ages  How these expectations differ is
in part a function of culture  For example, expectations for children who participate in
Western-style schooling are almost certain to be different from those for children who do
not participate in such schooling 

F [have suggested that there are three major implicit theories of how intelligence relates to
society as a whole (Sternberg, )  These might be called Hamiltonian, Jeffersonian, and
Jacksonian  These views are not based strictly, but rather, loosely, on the philosophies of
Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson, three great statesmen in the
history of the United States 

G The Hamiltonian view, which is similar to the Platonic view, is that people are born with
different levels of intelligence and that those who are less intelligent need the good offices
of the more intelligent to keep them in line, whether they are called government officials or,
in Plato�s term, philosopher-kings  Herrnstein and Murray () seem to have shared this
belief when they wrote about the emergence of a cognitive (high-IQ) elite, which eventually
would have to take responsibility for the largely irresponsible masses of non-elite (low-IQ)
people who cannot take care of themselves  Left to themselves, the unintelligent would
create, as they always have created, a kind of chaos 

H The Jeffersonian view is that people should have equal opportunities, but they do not
necessarily avail themselves equally of these opportunities and are not necessarily equally
rewarded for their accomplishments  People are rewarded for what they accomplish, if given
equal opportunity  Low achievers are not rewarded to the same extent as high achievers 

In the Jeffersonian view, the goal of education is not to favor or foster an elite, as in the
Hamiltonian tradition, but rather to allow children the opportunities to make full use of the
skills they have  My own views are similar to these (Sternberg, ) 

I The Jacksonian view is that all people are equal, not only as human beings but in terms
of their competencies � that one person would serve as well as another in government or
on a jury or in almost any position of responsibility  In this view of democracy, people are
essentially intersubstitutable except for specialized skills, all of which can be learned  In
this view, we do not need or want any institutions that might lead to favoring one group
over another 

J Implicit theories of intelligence and of the relationship of intelligence to society perhaps
need to be considered more carefully than they have been because they often serve as
underlying presuppositions for explicit theories and even experimental designs that are then
taken as scientific contributions  Until scholars are able to discuss their implicit theories
and thus their assumptions, they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when
discussing their explicit theories and their data

Passage  below 

Saving bugs to find new drugs
Zoologist Ross Piper looks at the potential of insects in
pharmaceutical research

A More drugs than you might think are derived from, or inspired by, compounds found
in living things  Looking to nature for the soothing and curing of our ailments is
nothing new � we have been doing it for tens of thousands of years  You only have
to look at other primates � such as the capuchin monkeys who rub themselves with
toxin-oozing millipedes to deter mosquitoes, or the chimpanzees who use noxious
forest plants to rid themselves of intestinal parasites � to realise that our ancient
ancestors too probably had a basic grasp of medicine 

B Pharmaceutical science and chemistry built on these ancient foundations and
perfected the extraction, characterisation, modification and testing of these natural
products  Then, for a while, modern pharmaceutical science moved its focus away
from nature and into the laboratory, designing chemical compounds from scratch 
The main cause of this shift is that although there are plenty of promising chemical
compounds in nature, finding them is far from easy  Securing sufficient numbers of
the organism in question, isolating and characterising the compounds of interest,
and producing large quantities of these compounds are all significant hurdles 

C  Laboratory-based drug discovery has achieved varying levels of success,
something which has now prompted the development of new approaches focusing
once again on natural products  With the ability to mine genomes for useful
compounds, it is now evident that we have barely scratched the surface of nature�s
molecular diversity  This realisation, together with several looming health crises,
such as antibiotic resistance, has put bioprospecting � the search for useful
compounds in nature � firmly back on the map 

D Insects are the undisputed masters of the terrestrial domain, where they occupy
every possible niche  Consequently, they have a bewildering array of interactions
with other organisms, something which has driven the evolution of an enormous
range of very interesting compounds for defensive and offensive purposes  Their
remarkable diversity exceeds that of every other group of animals on the planet
combined  Yet even though insects are far and away the most diverse animals in
existence, their potential as sources of therapeutic compounds is yet to be realised 


" "Test 

E From the tiny proportion of insects that have been investigated, several promising
compounds have been identified  For example, alloferon, an antimicrobial
compound produced by blow fly larvae, is used as an antiviral and antitumor agent
in South Korea and Russia  The larvae of a few other insect species are being
investigated for the potent antimicrobial compounds they produce  Meanwhile, a
compound from the venom of the wasp Polybia paulista has potential in cancer
treatment 

F Why is it that insects have received relatively little attention in bioprospecting?
Firstly, there are so many insects that, without some manner of targeted approach,
investigating this huge variety of species is a daunting task  Secondly, insects are
generally very small, and the glands inside them that secrete potentially useful
compounds are smaller still  This can make it difficult to obtain sufficient quantities
of the compound for subsequent testing  Thirdly, although we consider insects to be
everywhere, the reality of this ubiquity is vast numbers of a few extremely common
species  Many insect species are infrequently encountered and very difficult to rear
in captivity, which, again, can leave us with insufficient material to work with 

G My colleagues and | at Aberystwyth University in the UK have developed an
approach in which we use our knowledge of ecology as a guide to target our
efforts  The creatures that particularly interest us are the many insects that secrete
powerful poison for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for future consumption 
There are even more insects that are masters of exploiting filthy habitats, such as
faeces and carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by thousands of micro-
organisms  These insects have many antimicrobial compounds for dealing with
pathogenic bacteria and fungi, suggesting that there is certainly potential to find
many compounds that can serve as or inspire new antibiotics 

H� Although natural history knowledge points us in the right direction, it doesn�t
solve the problems associated with obtaining useful compounds from insects 
Fortunately, it is now possible to snip out the stretches of the insect�s DNA that
carry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that
allow larger quantities to be produced  And although the road from isolating and
characterising compounds with desirable qualities to developing a commercial
product is very long and full of pitfalls, the variety of successful animal-derived
pharmaceuticals on the market demonstrates there is a precedent here that is

worth exploring 

| With every bit of wilderness that disappears, we deprive ourselves of potential
medicines  As much as I'd love to help develop a groundbreaking insect-derived
medicine, my main motivation for looking at insects in this way is conservation  |
sincerely believe that all species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have
a right to exist for their own sake  If we can shine a light on the darker recesses
of nature�s medicine cabinet, exploring the useful chemistry of the most diverse
animals on the planet, | believe we can make people think differently about the
value of nature

Passage  below 
The power of play
Virtually every child, the world over, plays  The drive to play is so intense that children will do so
in any circumstances, for instance when they have no real toys, or when parents do not actively
encourage the behavior  In the eyes of a young child, running, pretending, and building are fun 
Researchers and educators know that these playful activities benefit the development of the
whole child across social, cognitive, physical, and emotional domains  Indeed, play is such an
instrumental component to healthy child development that the United Nations High Commission
on Human Rights () recognized play as a fundamental right of every child 
Yet, while experts continue to expound a powerful argument for the importance of play in
children�s lives, the actual time children spend playing continues to decrease  Today, children play
eight hours less each week than their counterparts did two decades ago (Elkind )  Under
pressure of rising academic standards, play is being replaced by test preparation in kindergartens
and grade schools, and parents who aim to give their preschoolers a leg up are led to believe
that flashcards and educational �toys� are the path to success  Our society has created a false
dichotomy between play and learning 
Through play, children learn to regulate their behavior, lay the foundations for later learning in
science and mathematics, figure out the complex negotiations of social relationships, build a
repertoire of creative problem-solving skills, and so much more  There is also an important role
for adults in guiding children through playful learning opportunities 
Full consensus on a formal definition of play continues to elude the researchers and theorists who
study it  Definitions range from discrete descriptions of various types of play such as physical,
construction, language, or symbolic play (Miller & Almon ), to lists of broad criteria, based
on observations and attitudes, that are meant to capture the essence of all play behaviors (e g 
Rubin et al  ) 
A majority of the contemporary definitions of play focus on several key criteria  The founder of
the National Institute for Play, Stuart Brown, has described play as �anything that spontaneously
is done for its own sake�  More specifically, he says it �appears purposeless, produces pleasure
and joy, [and] leads one to the next stage of mastery� (as quoted in Tippett )  Similarly, Miller
and Almon () say that play includes �activities that are freely chosen and directed by children
and arise from intrinsic motivation�  Often, play is defined along a continuum as more or less
playful using the following set of behavioral and dispositional criteria (e g  Rubin et al  ):
Play is pleasurable: Children must enjoy the activity or it is not play  It is intrinsically
motivated: Children engage in play simply for the satisfaction the behavior itself brings 
It has no extrinsically motivated function or goal  Play is process oriented: When children

play, the means are more important than the ends  It is freely chosen, spontaneous and
voluntary  Ifa child is pressured, they will likely not think of the activity as play  Play is
actively engaged: Players must be physically and/or mentally involved in the activity  Play
is non-literal  It involves make-believe 
According to this view, children�s playful behaviors can range in degree from % to %
playful  Rubin and colleagues did not assign greater weight to any one dimension in determining
playfulness; however, other researchers have suggested that process orientation and a lack of
obvious functional purpose may be the most important aspects of play (e g  Pellegrini ) 
From the perspective of a continuum, play can thus blend with other motives and attitudes that
are less playful, such as work  Unlike play, work is typically not viewed as enjoyable and it is
extrinsically motivated (i e  it is goal oriented)  Researcher Joan Goodman () suggested that
hybrid forms of work and play are not a detriment to learning; rather, they can provide optimal
contexts for learning  For example, a child may be engaged in a difficult, goal-directed activity
set up by their teacher, but they may still be actively engaged and intrinsically motivated  At this
mid-point between play and work, the child�s motivation, coupled with guidance from an adult,
can create robust opportunities for playful learning 
Critically, recent research supports the idea that adults can facilitate children�s learning while
maintaining a playful approach in interactions known as �guided play� (Fisher et al  )  The
adult�s role in play varies as a function of their educational goals and the child�s developmental
level (Hirsch-Pasek et al  ) 
Guided play takes two forms  At a very basic level, adults can enrich the child�s environment by
providing objects or experiences that promote aspects of a curriculum  In the more direct form
of guided play, parents or other adults can support children�s play by joining in the fun as a
co-player, raising thoughtful questions, commenting on children�s discoveries, or encouraging
further exploration or new facets to the child�s activity  Although playful learning can be
somewhat structured, it must also be child-centered (Nicolopolou et al  )  Play should stem
from the child�s own desire 
Both free and guided play are essential elements in a child-centered approach to playful learning 
Intrinsically motivated free play provides the child with true autonomy, while guided play is an
avenue through which parents and educators can provide more targeted learning experiences 
In either case, play should be actively engaged, it should be predominantly child-directed, and it
must be fun

The secret of staying young

Pheidole dentata, a native ant of the south-eastern U S , isn�t immortal  But scientists have found
that it doesn�t seem to show any signs of aging  Old worker ants can do everything just as well as
the youngsters, and their brains appear just as sharp  �We get a picture that these ants really don�t
decline,� says Ysabel Giraldo, who studied the ants for her doctoral thesis at Boston University 
Such age-defying feats are rare in the animal kingdom  Naked mole rats can live for almost

 years and stay fit for nearly their entire lives  They can still reproduce even when old, and they
never get cancer  But the vast majority of animals deteriorate with age just like people do  Like
the naked mole rat, ants are social creatures that usually live in highly organised colonies  �It�s
this social complexity that makes P dentata useful for studying aging in people,� says Giraldo,
now at the California Institute of Technology  Humans are also highly social, a trait that has been
connected to healthier aging  By contrast, most animal studies of aging use mice, worms or fruit
flies, which all lead much more isolated lives 

In the lab, P dentata worker ants typically live for around  days  Giraldo focused on ants

at four age ranges:  to  days,  to  days,  to  days and  to  days  Unlike all
previous studies, which only estimated how old the ants were, her work tracked the ants from the
time the pupae became adults, so she knew their exact ages  Then she put them through a range
of tests 

Giraldo watched how well the ants took care of the young of the colony, recording how often each
ant attended to, carried and fed them  She compared how well -day-old and -day-old ants
followed the telltale scent that the insects usually leave to mark a trail to food  She tested how
ants responded to light and also measured how active they were by counting how often ants in a
small dish walked across a line  And she experimented with how ants react to live prey: a tethered
fruit fly  Giraldo expected the older ants to perform poorly in all these tasks  But the elderly
insects were all good caretakers and trail-followers�the -day-old ants could track the scent
even longer than their younger counterparts  They all responded to light well, and the older ants
were more active  And when it came to reacting to prey, the older ants attacked the poor fruit fly
just as aggressively as the young ones did, flaring their mandibles or pulling at the fly�s legs 
Then Giraldo compared the brains of -day-old and -day-old ants, identifying any cells that
were close to death  She saw no major differences with age, nor was there any difference in the
location of the dying cells, showing that age didn�t seem to affect specific brain functions  Ants
and other insects have structures in their brains called mushroom bodies, which are important for

" "Reading
processing information, learning and memory  She also wanted to see if aging affects the density
of synaptic complexes within these structures�regions where neurons come together  Again, the
answer was no  What was more, the old ants didn�t experience any drop in the levels of either
serotonin or dopamine�brain chemicals whose decline often coincides with aging  In humans,
for example, a decrease in serotonin has been linked to Alzheimer�s disease 

�This is the first time anyone has looked at both behavioral and neural changes in these ants so
thoroughly,� says Giraldo, who recently published the findings in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society B  Scientists have looked at some similar aspects in bees, but the results of recent bee
studies were mixed�some studies showed age-related declines, which biologists call senescence,
and others didn�t  �For now, the study raises more questions than it answers,� Giraldo says,
�including how P dentata stays in such good shape �
Also, if the ants don�t deteriorate with age, why do they die at all? Out in the wild, the ants
probably don�t live for a full  days thanks to predators, disease and just being in an
environment that�s much harsher than the comforts of the lab  �The lucky ants that do live into old
age may suffer a steep decline just before dying,� Giraldo says, but she can�t say for sure because
her study wasn�t designed to follow an ant�s final moments 
�It will be important to extend these findings to other species of social insects,� says Gene E 
Robinson, an entomologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  This ant might be
unique, or it might represent a broader pattern among other social bugs with possible clues to the
science of aging in larger animals  Either way, it seems that for these ants, age really
doesn�t matter

Passage  below 

Why zoos are good
Scientist David Hone makes the case for zoos

A In my view, it is perfectly possible for many species of animals living in zoos
or wildlife parks to have a quality of life as high as, or higher than, in the wild 
Animals in good zoos get a varied and high-quality diet with all the supplements
required, and any illnesses they might have will be treated  Their movement might
be somewhat restricted, but they have a safe environment in which to live, and
they are spared bullying and social ostracism by others of their kind  They do not
suffer from the threat or stress of predators, or the irritation and pain of parasites or
injuries  The average captive animal will have a greater life expectancy compared
with its wild counterpart, and will not die of drought, of starvation or in the jaws of
a predator  A lot of very nasty things happen to truly �wild� animals that simply don�t
happen in good zoos, and to view a life that is �free� as one that is automatically
�good� is, | think, an error  Furthermore, zoos serve several key purposes 

B Firstly, zoos aid conservation  Colossal numbers of species are becoming extinct
across the world, and many more are increasingly threatened and therefore risk
extinction  Moreover, some of these collapses have been sudden, dramatic and
unexpected, or were simply discovered very late in the day  A species protected
in captivity can be bred up to provide a reservoir population against a population
crash or extinction in the wild  A good number of species only exist in captivity, with
many of these living in zoos  Still more only exist in the wild because they have
been reintroduced from zoos, or have wild populations that have been boosted
by captive bred animals  Without these efforts there would be fewer species alive
today  Although reintroduction successes are few and far between, the numbers
are increasing, and the very fact that species have been saved or reintroduced as a
result of captive breeding proves the value of such initiatives 

C Zoos also provide education  Many children and adults, especially those in cities,
will never see a wild animal beyond a fox or pigeon  While it is true that television
documentaries are becoming ever more detailed and impressive, and many
natural history specimens are on display in museums, there really is nothing to
compare with seeing a living creature in the flesh, hearing it, smelling it, watching
what it does and having the time to absorb details  That alone will bring a greater
understanding and perspective to many, and hopefully give them a greater
appreciation for wildlife, conservation efforts and how they can contribute 


" "Reading

D In addition to this, there is also the education that can take place in zoos through
signs, talks and presentations which directly communicate information to visitors
about the animals they are seeing and their place in the world  This was an area
where zoos used to be lacking, but they are now increasingly sophisticated in
their communication and outreach work  Many zoos also work directly to educate
conservation workers in other countries, or send their animal keepers abroad
to contribute their knowledge and skills to those working in zoos and reserves,
thereby helping to improve conditions and reintroductions all over the world 

E Zoos also play a key role in research  If we are to save wild species and restore
and repair ecosystems we need to know about how key species live, act and react 
Being able to undertake research on animals in zoos where there is less risk and
fewer variables means real changes can be effected on wild populations  Finding
out about, for example, the oestrus cycle of an animal or its breeding rate helps
us manage wild populations  Procedures such as capturing and moving at-risk or
dangerous individuals are bolstered by knowledge gained in zoos about doses for
anaesthetics, and by experience in handling and transporting animals  This can
make a real difference to conservation efforts and to the reduction of human-animal
conflicts, and can provide a knowledge base for helping with the increasing threats
of habitat destruction and other problems 

F  Inconclusion, considering the many ongoing global threats to the environment, it is
hard for me to see zoos as anything other than essential to the long-term survival
of numerous species  They are vital not just in terms of protecting animals, but as
a means of learning about them to aid those still in the wild, as well as educating
and informing the general population about these animals and their world so that
they can assist or at least accept the need to be more environmentally conscious 
Without them, the world would be, and would increasingly become, a much
poorer place

Passage  below 

THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN�S PLAY

Brick by brick, six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom  Imagining fairy-tale turrets and
fire-breathing dragons, wicked witches and gallant heroes, she�s creating an enchanting world 
Although she isn�t aware of it, this fantasy is helping her take her first steps towards her capacity for
creativity and so it will have important repercussions in her adult life 

Minutes later, Alice has abandoned the kingdom in favour of playing schools with her younger
brother  When she bosses him around as his �teacher�, she�s practising how to regulate her emotions
through pretence  Later on, when they tire of this and settle down with a board game, she�s learning
about the need to follow rules and take turns with a partner 

�Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of the human species,� says

Dr David Whitebread from the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge, UK  �It
underpins how we develop as intellectual, problem-solving adults and is crucial to our success as 
a highly adaptable species �

Recognising the importance of play is not new: over two millennia ago, the Greek philosopher
Plato extolled its virtues as a means of developing skills for adult life, and ideas about play-based
learning have been developing since the th century 

But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a worldwide decline in play, pointing
out that over half the people in the world now live in cities  �The opportunities for free play, which
I experienced almost every day of my childhood, are becoming increasingly scarce,� he says 
Outdoor play is curtailed by perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as parents� increased
wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime, and by the emphasis on �earlier is
better� which is leading to greater competition in academic learning and schools 
International bodies like the United Nations and the European Union have begun to develop
policies concerned with children�s right to play, and to consider implications for leisure facilities
and educational programmes  But what they often lack is the evidence to base policies on 

�The type of play we are interested in is child-initiated, spontaneous and unpredictable � but, as
soon as you ask a five-year-old �to play�, then you as the researcher have intervened,� explains
Dr Sara Baker  �And we want to know what the long-term impact of play is  It�s a real challenge �

Passage  below 
Chelsea Rochman, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis, has been trying to answer
a dismal question: Is everything terrible, or are things just very, very bad?
Rochman is a member of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis�s
marine-debris working group, a collection of scientists who study, among other things, the
growing problem of marine debris, also known as ocean trash  Plenty of studies have sounded
alarm bells about the state of marine debris; in a recent paper published in the journal Ecology,
Rochman and her colleagues set out to determine how many of those perceived risks are real 
Often, Rochman says, scientists will end a paper by speculating about the broader impacts of
what they�ve found  For example, a study could show that certain seabirds eat plastic bags, and
go on to warn that whole bird populations are at risk of dying out  �But the truth was that nobody
had yet tested those perceived threats,� Rochman says  �There wasn�t a lot of information �
Rochman and her colleagues examined more than a hundred papers on the impacts of marine
debris that were published through   Within each paper, they asked what threats scientists
had studied �  perceived threats in all � and what they'd actually found 
In  percent of cases, the perceived dangers of ocean trash were proven true  In the remaining
cases, the working group found the studies had weaknesses in design and content which affected
the validity of their conclusions � they lacked a control group, for example, or used faulty
statistics 
Strikingly, Rochman says, only one well-designed study failed to find the effect it was looking
for, an investigation of mussels ingesting microscopic plastic bits  The plastic moved from the
mussels� stomachs to their bloodstreams, scientists found, and stayed there for weeks � but didn�t
seem to stress out the shellfish 
While mussels may be fine eating trash, though, the analysis also gave a clearer picture of the
many ways that ocean debris is bothersome 
Within the studies they looked at, most of the proven threats came from plastic debris, rather than
other materials like metal or wood  Most of the dangers also involved large pieces of debris �
animals getting entangled in trash, for example, or eating it and severely injuring themselves 
But a lot of ocean debris is �microplastic�, or pieces smaller than five millimeters  These may
be ingredients used in cosmetics and toiletries, fibers shed by synthetic clothing in the wash, or
eroded remnants of larger debris  Compared to the number of studies investigating large-scale
debris, Rochman�s group found little research on the effects of these tiny bits  �There are a lot of
open questions still for microplastic,� Rochman says, though she notes that more papers on the
subject have been published since , the cutoff point for the group�s analysis 

" "Reading
There are also, she adds, a lot of open questions about the ways that ocean debris can lead to
sea-creature death  Many studies have looked at how plastic affects an individual animal, or that
animal�s tissues or cells, rather than whole populations  And in the lab, scientists often use higher
concentrations of plastic than what�s really in the ocean  None of that tells us how many birds or
fish or sea turtles could die from plastic pollution � or how deaths in one species could affect that
animal�s predators, or the rest of the ecosystem 
�We need to be asking more ecologically relevant questions,� Rochman says  Usually, scientists
don�t know exactly how disasters such as a tanker accidentally spilling its whole cargo of oil and
polluting huge areas of the ocean will affect the environment until after they�ve happened  �We
don�t ask the right questions early enough,� she says  But if ecologists can understand how the
slow-moving effect of ocean trash is damaging ecosystems, they might be able to prevent things
from getting worse 
Asking the right questions can help policy makers, and the public, figure out where to focus their
attention  The problems that look or sound most dramatic may not be the best places to start  For
example, the name of the �Great Pacific Garbage Patch� � a collection of marine debris in the
northern Pacific Ocean ~ might conjure up a vast, floating trash island  In reality though, much
of the debris is tiny or below the surface; a person could sail through the area without seeing
any trash at all  A Dutch group called �The Ocean Cleanup� is currently working on plans to put
mechanical devices in the Pacific Garbage Patch and similar areas to suck up plastic  But a recent
paper used simulations to show that strategically positioning the cleanup devices closer to shore
would more effectively reduce pollution over the long term 
�I think clearing up some of these misperceptions is really important,� Rochman says 
Among scientists as well as in the media, she says, �A lot of the images about strandings and
entanglement and all of that cause the perception that plastic debris is killing everything in
the ocean � Interrogating the existing scientific literature can help ecologists figure out which
problems really need addressing, and which ones they�d be better off� like the mussels �
absorbing and ignoring

Dr Jenny Gibson agrees, pointing out that although some of the steps in the puzzle of how and
why play is important have been looked at, there is very little data on the impact it has on the
child�s later life 
Now, thanks to the university�s new Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and
Learning (PEDAL), Whitebread, Baker, Gibson and a team of researchers hope to provide evidence
on the role played by play in how a child develops 
�A strong possibility is that play supports the early development of children�s self-control,�
explains Baker  �This is our ability to develop awareness of our own thinking processes � it
influences how effectively we go about undertaking challenging activities �
Ina study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young pre-schoolers, she found that children with
greater self-control solved problems more quickly when exploring an unfamiliar set-up requiring
scientific reasoning  �This sort of evidence makes us think that giving children the chance to play will
make them more successful problem-solvers in the long run �
If playful experiences do facilitate this aspect of development, say the researchers, it could be
extremely significant for educational practices, because the ability to self-regulate has been
shown to be a key predictor of academic performance 
Gibson adds: �Playful behaviour is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional
development  In my previous research, I investigated how observing children at play can
give us important clues about their well-being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of
neurodevelopmental disorders like autism �
Whitebread�s recent research has involved developing a play-based approach to supporting
children�s writing  �Many primary school children find writing difficult, but we showed in a
previous study that a playful stimulus was far more effective than an instructional one � Children
wrote longer and better-structured stories when they first played with dolls representing
characters in the story  In the latest study, children first created their story with Lego*, with
similar results  �Many teachers commented that they had always previously had children saying
they didn�t know what to write about  With the Lego building, however, not a single child said
this through the whole year of the project �
Whitebread, who directs PEDAL, trained as a primary school teacher in the early s, when,
as he describes, �the teaching of young children was largely a quiet backwater, untroubled by any
serious intellectual debate or controversy � Now, the landscape is very different, with hotly debated
topics such as school starting age 
�Somehow the importance of play has been lost in recent decades  It�s regarded as something
trivial, or even as something negative that contrasts with �work�  Let�s not lose sight of its
benefits, and the fundamental contributions it makes to human achievements in the arts, sciences
and technology  Let�s make sure children have a rich diet of play experiences �
* Lego: coloured plastic building blocks and other pieces that can be joined together
