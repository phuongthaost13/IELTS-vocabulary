Test    READING READING PASSAGE  You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading Passage  below  Nutmeg   a valuable spice The utmeg tree  Myristica fragrans  is a large evergreen tree ative to Southeast Asia  Until the late th century  it only grew in one place in the world  a small group of islands in the Banda Sea  part of the Mohuceas   or Spice Islands   in ortheastern Indonesia  The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough  dark green oval leaves  and produces small  yellow  bell shaped flowers and pale yellow pear shaped fruits  The fruit is encased in a fleshy husk  When the fruit is ripe  this husk splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit  Inside is a purple brown shiny seed    cm long by about cm across  surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an  aril   These are the sources of the two spices utmeg and mace  the former being produced from the dried seed and the Jatter from the aril  Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages  and was used as a flavouring  medicinal  and preservative agent  Throughout this period  the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the spice to Europe  They sold utmeg for high prices to merchants  based in Venice  but they ever revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity  i The Arab Venetian dominance of the trade finally ended in   when the Portuguese reached the Banda Islands and began exploiting its precious resources  Always in danger of competition from eighbouring Spain  the Portuguese began subcontracting their spice distribution to Dutch traders  Profits began to flow into the Netherlands  and the Dutch   commercial fleet swiftly grew into one of the largest in the world  The Dutch quietly gained control i of most of the shipping and trading of spices in Northern Europe  Then  in   Portugal fell under Spanish rule  and by the end of the th century the Dutch found themselves locked out of the market  As prices for pepper  utmeg  and other spices soared across Europe  they decided to fight back  f In   Dutch merchants founded the VOC  a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East India Company  By   the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world  The company   had   employees worldwide  with a private army of   men and a fleet of  ships  At the same time  thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague  a highly contagious and deadly disease  Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease  and they decided nutmeg held the cure  Everybody wanted utmeg  and many were willing to spare o expense to have it  Nutmeg bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for   times its original cost on the streets of London  The only problem was the short supply  And that s where the Dutch found   their opportunity    " "X  Reading a  The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a eutral trading De policy towards foreign powers  This allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish    troops on their soil  but it also left them unprotected from other invaders  In   the Dutch arrived and took over  Once securely in control of the Bandas  the Dutch went to work protecting their ew investment  They concentrated all utmeg production into a few easily guarded areas  co uprooting and destroying any trees outside the plantation zones  Anyone caught growing a utmeg    seedling or carrying seeds without the proper authority was severely punished  In addition     all exported utmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was o chance a fertile seed  which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands  There was only one obstacle to Dutch   domination  One of the Banda Islands  a sliver of and called Run  only  km long by less than   km wide  was under the control of the British  After decades of fighting for control of this tiny    Ggland  the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement  the Treaty of Breda  in     Intent on securing their hold over every utmeg producing island  the Dutch offered a trade  if the British would give them the island of Run  they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less   valuable island in North America  The British agreed  That other island was Manhattan  which is   how New Amsterdam became New York  The Dutch ow had a monopoly over the utmeg trade i which would last for another century  Then  in   a Frenchman amed Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled utmeg plants to safety   in Mauritius  an island off the coast of Africa  Some of these were later exported to the Caribbean where they thrived  especially on the island of Grenada  Next  in   a volcanic eruption in the   Banda region caused a tsunami that wiped out half the utmeg groves  Finally  in   the British  retuned to Indonesia and seized the Banda Islands by force  They returned the islands to the   Duteh in   but ot before transplanting hundreds of utmeg seedlings to plantations in several   locations across southern Asia  The Dutch utmeg monopoly was over     Today  utmeg is grown in Indonesia  the Caribbean  India  Malaysia  Papua New Guinea and  Sri Lanka  and world utmeg production is estimated to average between   and   tonnes   per year     " "X Test  a Questions

READING PASSAGE     You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading  Passage  below   Driverless cars  A The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in manufacturing  The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the s onwards led to significant cost savings and improvements in the reliability and flexibility of vehicle mass production  A ew challenge to vehicle production is ow on the horizon and  again  it comes from automation  However  this time it is ot to do with the manufacturing process  but with the vehicles themselves   Research projects on vehicle automation are ot ew  Vehicies with limited self  driving capabilities have been around for more than  years  resulting in significant contributions towards driver assistance systems  But since Google announced in  that it had been trialling self driving cars on the streets of California  progress in this field has quickly gathered pace   B There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast  One frequently cited motive is safety  indeed  research at the UK s Transport Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than  percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory factor  and it is the primary cause in the vast majority  Automation may help to reduce the incidence of this   Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes  if the vehicle can do some or all of the driving  it may be possible to be productive  to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle  If the vehicle can do the driving  those who are challenged by existing mobility models   such as older or disabled travellers   may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy   C Beyond these direct benefits  we can consider the wider implications for transport and society  and how manufacturing processes might eed to respond as a  result  At present  the average car spends more than  percent of its life parked   Automation means that initiatives for car sharing become much more viable   particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand  If a significant proportion  of the population choose to use shared automated vehicles  mobility demand can be met by far fewer vehicles   D The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated mobility in Singapore  finding that fewer than  percent of the vehicles currently used would be required if fully automated car sharing could be implemented  If this is the case  it might mean that we eed to manufacture far fewer vehicles to meet demand     " "X oe Reading   However  the umber of trips being taken would probably increase  partly because   empty vehicles would have to be moved from one customer to the ext  Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute   suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by  percent  but  that vehicles  average annual mileage would double as a result  As a consequence  z each vehicie would be used more intensively  and might eed replacing a sooner  This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle production will ot J ecessarily decrease      Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture  If we move to a a model where consumers are tending ot to own a single vehicle but to purchase   access to a range of vehicles through a mobility provider  drivers will have the  freedom to select one that best suits their eeds for a particular journey  rather than A making a compromise across all their requirements  i Since  for most of the time  most of the seats in most cars are unoccupied  this may   boost production of a smaller  more efficient range of vehicles that suit the eeds   of individuals  Specialised vehicles may then be available for exceptional journeys  such as going on a family camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to   university    F There are a umber of hurdies to overcome in delivering automated vehicles j to our roads  These include the technical difficulties in ensuring that the vehicle   works reliably in the infinite range of traffic  weather and road situations it might   encounter  the regulatory challenges in understanding how liability and enforcement   might change when drivers are o longer essential for vehicle operation  and the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept   automated vehicles as being a valuable part of the mobility landscape    G it s clear that there are many challenges that eed to be addressed but  through   robust and targeted research  these can most probably be conquered within the next  years  Mobility will change in such potentially significant ways and in association with so many other technological developments  such as telepresence i and virtual reality  that it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future  However  one thing is certain  change is coming  and the eed to be flexible in response to this will be vital for those involved in manufacturing the vehicles that will deliver future mobility    " "X Test    Questions     Reading

 which are basedon Reading Passage  below  What is exploration     We are all explorers  Our desire to discover  and then share that ew found knowledge  is part   of what makes us human   indeed  this has played an important part in our success as a species  Long before the first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted ews that there were   plenty of wildebeest over yonder  our ancestors had learnt the value of sending out scouts to   investigate the unknown  This questing ature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread   around the globe  just as it owadays o doubt helps the last omadic Penan maintain their existence in the depleted forests of Borneo  and a visitor egotiate the subways of New York   Over the years  we ve come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed   different from the rest of us  different from those of us who are merely  well travelled   even  and perhaps there is a type of person more suited to seeking out the ew  a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out  That  however  doesn t take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct  even today  and that in all sorts of professions   whether artist  marine biologist or astronomer   borders of the unknown are being tested each day  Thomas Hardy set some of his ovels in Egdon Heath  a fictional area of uncultivated land  and   used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters  He is delving into matters  we all recognise because they are common to humanity  This is surely an act of exploration  and   into a world as remote as the author chooses  Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones  The traveller  who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling Jaboriously over a country in which he has o roots and o background  suddenly encounters his other self  a relatively solid figure  with a place in the minds of certain people   In this book about the exploration of the earth s surface  I have confined myself to those whose travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery  But that still left me with another problem  the word  explorer  has become associated with a past era  We think back to a golden  age  as if exploration peaked somehow in the th century   as if the process of discovery is ow on the decline  though the truth is that we have amed only one and a half million of this planet s species  and there may be more than  million   and that s ot including bacteria  We have studied only  per cent of the species we know  We have scarcely mapped  the ocean floors  and know even less about ourselves  we fully understand the workings of only  per cent of our brains      " "X   Reading   Here is how some of today s  explorers  define the word  Ran Fiennes  dubbed the  greatest   living explorer   said   An explorer is someone who has done something that o human has done    before   and also done something scientifically useful   Chris Bonington  a leading mountaineer  felt exploration was to be found in the act of physically touching the unknown   You have to   have gone somewhere ew   Then Robin Hanbury Tenison  a campaigner on behalf of remote e so called  tribal  peoples  said   A traveller simply records information about some far off world  i and reports back  but an explorer changes the world   Wilfred Thesiger  who crossed Arabia s c Empty Quarter in   and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel ow lost to the rest of us    told me   If I d gone across by camel when I could have gone by car  it would have been a stunt    To him  exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great   self discovery    Each definition is slightly different    and tends to refiect the field of endeavour of each pioneer  It   was the same whoever J asked  the prominent historian would say exploration was a thing of the a past  the cutting edge scientist would say it was of the present  And so on  They each set their own   particular criteria  the common factor in their approach being that they all had  unlike many of us   who simply enjoy travel or discovering ew things  both a very definite objective from the outset  and also a desire to record their findings    I d best declare my own bias  As a writer  I m interested in the exploration of ideas  I ve done   a great many expeditions and each one was unique  I ve lived for months alone with isolated   groups of people all around the world  even two  uncontacted tribes   But one of these things   is of the slightest interest to anyone unless  through my books  I ve found a ew slant  explored   anew idea  Why  Because the world has moved on  The time has long passed for the great   continental voyages   another walk to the poles  another crossing of the Empty Quarter  We   know how the Jand surface of our planet lies  exploration of it is ow down to the details   the   habits of microbes  say  or the grazing behaviour of buffalo  Aside from the deep sea and deep   underground  it s the era of specialists  However  this is to disregard the role the human mind has   in conveying remote places  and this is what interests me  how a fresh interpretation  even of a well travelled route  can give its readers ew insights    " "X Test    Questions       Choose the correct letter  A  B  C or D    Write the correct letter in boxes   on your answer sheet      The writer refers to visitors to New

Could urban engineers learn from dance    A The way we travel around cities has a major impact on whether they are sustainable  Le Transportation is estimated to account for   of energy consumption in most of the ce world s most developed ations  so lowering the eed for energy using vehicles is essential c for decreasing the environmental impact of mobility  But as more and more people move to a cities  it is important to think about other kinds of sustainable travel too  The ways we travel a affect our physical and mental health  our social lives  our access to work and culture  and   the ait we breathe  Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities through   urban design  but the engineering industry still works on the assumptions that led to the L creation of the energy consuming transport systems we have ow  the emphasis placed i solely on efficiency  speed  and quantitative data  We eed radical changes  to make it   healthier  more enjoyable  and less environmentally damaging to travel around cities    B Dance might hold some of the answers  That is ot to suggest everyone should dance their   way to work  however healthy and happy it might make us  but rather that the techniques i used by choreographers to experiment with and design movement in dance could provide   engineers with tools to stimulate ew ideas in city making  Richard Sennett  an influential   urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about the way cities are made    argues that urban design has suffered from a separation between mind and body since the   introduction of the architectural blueprint    C Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate   knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site  building designs   are ow conceived and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the   physical and social realities they are creating  While the design practices created by these   ew technologies are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city    they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process    D To illustrate  Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta  USA  a development typical   of the modernist approach to urban planning prevalent in the s  Peachtree created a grid of streets and towers intended as a ew pedestrian friendly downtown for Atlanta  According to Sennett  this failed because its designers had invested too much faith in computer aided   design to tell them how it would operate  They failed to take into account that purpose built i street cafï¿½s could ot operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older buildings  and would eed energy consuming air conditioning instead  or that its giant car park would feel so unwelcoming that it would put people off getting out of their cars  What seems entirely predictable and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated into reality      " "X Test     E The same is true in transport engineering  which uses models to predict and shape the   way people move through the city  Again  these models are ecessary  but they are built on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered e and other experiences of the city ignored  Designs that seem logical in models appear i counter intuitive in the actual experience of their users  The guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road  for example  were an engineering   solution to pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of traffic  On    wide major roads  they often guide pedestrians to specific crossing points and slow down A their progress across the road by using staggered access points to divide the crossing into   two   one for each carriageway  In doing so they make crossings feel longer  introducing   psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile  and encouraging   others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails  These barriers don t   just make it harder to cross the road  they divide communities and decrease opportunities   for healthy transport  As a result  many are ow being removed  causing disruption  cost    and waste     F If their designers had had the tools to think with their bodies   like dancers   and imagine S how these barriers would feel  there might have been a better solution  In order to bring   about fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities  engineering will eed to develop   a richer understanding of why people move in certain ways  and how this movement affects Q them  Choreography may ot seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem  Yet it shares with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space   It is an art form developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body  and gaining   instant feedback on how the results feel  Choreographers have deep understanding of the psychological  aesthetic  and physical implications of different ways of moving   G   Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor  cognitive scientist David Kirsh described how he  thinks with the body   Kirsh argues that by using the body to simulate outcomes  McGregor is able to imagine solutions that would ot be possible using purely abstract thought  This kind of physical knowledge is valued in many areas of expertise  but currently has o place in formal engineering design processes  A suggested method for transport engineers is to improvise design solutions and get instant feedback about how they would work from their own experience of them  or model designs at full scale in the way choreographers experiment with groups of dancers  Above all  perhaps  they might learn to design for emotional as well as functional effects     " "X  Reading Questions      Reading Passage  has

   You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading Passage  below    Should we try to bring extinct species back to life    A  The passenger pigeon was a legendary species  Flying in vast umbers across   North America  with potentially many millions within a single flock  their migration was once one of ature s great spectacles  Sadly  the passenger pigeon s existence came to an end on  September   when the last living specimen died at   Cincinnati Zoo  Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which ow aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as  de  extinction   The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo  which is carried by the earest relative still in existence   in this case  the abundant band tailed pigeon   before being born as a living  breathing animal  Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in this field  but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting edge technology is being trialled  B In Australia  the thylacine  more commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger  is another extinct creature which genetic scientists are striving to bring back to life   There is o carnivore ow in Tasmania that fills the iche which thylacines once occupied   explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales  He points out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct  there has been a spread in a  dangerously debilitating  facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils  the island s other otorious resident  Thylacines would i have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant umbers   of Tasmanian devils   If that contagious cancer had popped up previously  it would i have burned out in whatever region it started  The return of thylacines to Tasmania   could help to ensure that devils are ever again subjected to risks of this kind   C If extinct species can be brought back to life  can humanity begin to correct the damage it has caused to the atural world over the past few millennia   The idea of de extinction is that we can reverse this process  bringing species that o longer exist back to life   says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz s Genomics Institute   I don t think that we can do this  There is o way to bring back something that is  per cent identical to a species that went extinct a long time ago   A more practical approach for long extinct species is to take the DNA of existing species as a template  ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal DNA to create something ew  a hybrid  based on the living species  but which looks and or acts like the animal which died out    " "X a Reading   p  This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question  what is       the actual point of this technology   For us  the goal has always been replacing the extinct species with a suitable replacement   expiains Novak   When it comes     to breeding  band tailed pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two ests per hectare  whereas passenger pigeons were very social and would make   eo or more ests in one hectare   Since the disappearance of this key species   ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered  as the lack of disturbance caused    by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there a has been minimal eed for regrowth  This has left forests stagnant and therefore   unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest   after a disturbance  According to Novak  a hybridised band tailed pigeon  with the a added esting habits of a passenger pigeon  could  in theory  re establish that forest disturbance  thereby creating a habitat ecessary for a great many other a ative species to thrive  E Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth  George a Church  professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth   Revival Project  has been focusing on cold resistance  the main way in which the   extinct woolly mammoth and its earest living relative  the Asian elephant  differ    By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the   icy climate of the tundra  the project s goal is to return mammoths  or a mammoth  i like species  to the area   My highest priority would be preserving the endangered   Asian elephant   says Church   expanding their range to the huge ecosystem of the   tundra  Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears  thicker hair  and extra insulating fat  all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra  and all traits i found in the ow extinct woolly mammoth   This repopulation of the tundra and     boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a   useful factor in reducing carbon emissions   elephants punch holes through snow   and knock down trees  which encourages grass growth  This grass growth would   reduce temperatures  and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost    F While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might capture   imaginations  it is  of course  far easier to try to save an existing species which   is merely threatened with extinction   Many of the technologies that people have i in mind when they think about de extinction can be used as a form of  genetic   rescue    explains Shapiro  She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging  technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place  and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications i which could prevent mass extinctions in the future   I would also say there s an   incredible moral hazard to ot do anything at all   she continues   We know that L what we are doing today is ot enough  and we have to be willing to take some   calculated and measured risks      LL

Reading   Passage  below    Having a laugh   The findings of psychological scientists reveal the importance of humour   Humans start developing a sense of humour as early as six weeks old  when babies begin to laugh   and smile in response to stimuli  Laughter is universal across all human cultures and even exisis   in some form in rats  chimps  and bonobos  Like other human emotions and expressions  laughter and humour provide psychological scientists with rich resources for studying human psychology    ranging from the development of language to the euroscience of social perception  Theories focusing on the evolution of laughter point to it as an important adaptation for social communication  Take  for example  the recorded laughter in TV comedy shows  Back in   US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live audiences  so started recording his own  laugh tracks   These were intended to help people at home feel like they were in a social situation  such as a crowded theatre  Douglass even recorded various types of laughter  as well as mixtures of laughter from men  women  and children  In doing so  he picked up on a quality of laughter that is ow interesting researchers  a simple  haba  communicates a remarkable amount of socially relevant information  In one study conducted in   samples of laughter from pairs of English speaking students were recorded at the University of California  Santa Cruz  A team made up of more than  psychological scientists  anthropologists  and biologists then played these recordings to listeners from  diverse societies  from indigenous tribes in New Guinea to city dwellers in India and Europe  Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or strangers  On average  the results were remarkably consistent  worldwide  people s guesses were correct approximately   of the time  Researchers have also found that different types of laughter serve as codes to complex human social hierarchies  A team led by Christopher Oveis from the University of California  San Diego  found that high status individuals had different laughs from low status individuals  and that strangers  judgements of an individual s social  status were influenced by the dominant or submissive quality of their laughter  In their study   male college students were randomly assigned to groups of four  with each group composed of two low status members  who had just joined their college fraternity group  and two high status members  older students who had been  active in the fraternity for at least two years  Laughter was recorded as each student took a turn at being teased by the others  involving the use of mildly insulting icknames  Analysis revealed that  as expected  high status individuals produced more dominant laughs and fewer submissive laughs relative to the low status individuals  Meanwhile  low status individuals were more likely to change their laughter based on their position of power  that is  the ewcomers produced more   " "X  Reading   dominant laughs when they were in the  powerful  role of teasers  Dominant laughter was higher a in pitch  louder  and more variable in tone than submissive laughter  a A random group of volunteers then listened to an equal umber of dominant and submissive laughs from both the high  and low status individuals  and were asked to estimate the social status   of the laugher  In line with predictions  laughers producing dominant laughs were perceived to be E significantly higher in status than laughers producing submissive laughs   This was particularly true for low status individuals  who were rated as significantly higher in status when displaying a i dominant versus submissive laugh   Oveis and colleagues ote   Thus  by strategically displaying   more dominant laughter when the context allows  low status individuals may achieve higher   status in the eyes of others   However  high status individuals were rated as high status whether   they produced their atural dominant laugh or tried to do a submissive one  i Another study  conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of Australian National University  a was based on the hypothesis that humour might provide a respite from tedious situations in the workplace  This  mental break  might facilitate the replenishment of mental resources  To test this A theory  the researchers recruited  business students  ostensibly for an experiment on perception    First  the students performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance of the   etter  e  over two pages of text  The students then were randomly assigned to watch a video   clip eliciting either humour  contentment  or eutral feelings  Some watched a clip of the BBC  comedy Mr  Bean  others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean  and others a   factual video about the management profession        The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess   the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles  and were told that making    correct assessments in a row would lead to a win  However  the software was programmed   such that it was early impossible to achieve  consecutive correct answers  Participants were  allowed to quit the task at any point  Students who had watched the Mr Bean video ended up  spending significantly more time working on the task  making twice as many predictions as the ï¿½ other two groups  Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study  during which they had participants complete long multiplication questions by hand  Again  participants who watched the   humorous video spent significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed more   questions correctly than did the students in either of the other groups     Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate social relationships  the traditional view of task performance implies that individuals should avoid things such as humour   that may distract them from the accomplishment of task goals   Cheng and Wang conclude   We   Suggest that humour is ot only enjoyable but more importantly  energising   i  L   a  " "X Test    r Be Questions       i Choose the correct letter  A  B  C or D  Write the correct letter in boxes

about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading Passage  below    Henry Moore       The British sculptor Henry Moore was a leading figure   in the th century art world   Henry Moore was born in Castleford  a small town ear Leeds in the orth of England  He was the seventh child of Raymond Moore and his wife Mary Baker  Ele studied at Castleford   Grammar School from  to   where his early interest in art was encouraged by his teacher Alice Gostick  After leaving school  Moore hoped to become a sculptor  but instead he complied   with his father s wish that he train as a schoolteacher  He had to abandon his training in  when he was sent to France to fight in the First World War  After the war  Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of  Art  where he studied for two years  In his   first year  he spent most of his time drawing  Although he wanted to study sculpture  o teacher was appointed until his second year  At the end of that year  he passed the sculpture examination   and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London  In September   he   moved to London and began three years of advanced study in sculpture  Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College  Moore visited many of the London museums  particularly the British Museum  which had a wide ranging collection of ancient sculpture  During these visits  he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and African sculpture  As he became increasingly interested in these  primitive  forms of art  he turned away from European sculptural traditions  After graduating  Moore spent the first six months of  travelling in France  When he visited Q the Trocadero Museum in Paris  he was impressed by a cast of a Mayan  sculpture of the rain spirit  It was a male reclining figure with its knees drawn up together  and its head at a right angle to its body  Moore became fascinated with this stone sculpture  which he thought had a power and originality that o other stone sculpture possessed  He himself started carving a variety of subjects in stone  including depictions of reclining women  mother and child groups  and masks  Moore s exceptional talent soon gained recognition  and in  he started work as a sculpture instructor at the Royal College  In   he became a member of a group of young artists called Unit One  The aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of the emerging international movement in modern art and architecture    Mayan  belonging to an ancient civilisation that inhabited parts of current day Mexico  Guatemala  Belize  El Salvador and Honduras   rata i  " "X   Reading a ground this time  Moore moved away from the human figure to experiment with abstract shapes    In   he held an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London  His work was enthusiastically  welcomed by fellow sculptors  but the reviews in the press were extremely egative and turned   Moore into a otorious figure  There were calls for his resignation from the Royal College  eS and the following year  when his contract expired  he left to start a sculpture department at the   Chelsea School of Art in London  L Throughout the s  Moore did ot show any inclination to please the British public  He   became interested in the paintings of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso  whose work inspired him   to distort the human body in a radical way  At times  he seemed to abandon the human figure   altogether  The pages of his sketchbooks from this period show his ideas for abstract sculptures f that bore little resemblance to the human form  iE In   during the Second World War  Moore stopped teaching at the Chelsea School and moved   to a farmhouse about  miles orth of London  A shortage of materials forced him to focus   on drawing  He did umerous small sketches of Londoners  later turning these ideas into large coloured drawings in his studio  In   he returned to Castleford to make a series of sketches of E the miners who worked there  t In   Harlow  a town ear London  offered Moore a commission for a sculpture depicting   a family  The resulting work signifies a dramatic change in Moore s style  away from the   experimentation of the s towards a more atural and humanistic subject matter  He did   dozens of studies in clay for the sculpture  and these were cast in bronze and issued in editions of seven to ine copies each  In this way  Moore s work became available to collectors all over the   world  The boost to his income enabled him to take on ambitious projects and start working on C the scale he felt his sculpture demanded    Critics who had begun to think that Moore had become less revolutionary were proven wrong   by the appearance  in   of the first of Moore s series of standing figures in bronze  with their   harsh and anguiar pierced forms and distinct impression of menace  Moore also varied his subject   matter in the s with such works as Warrior with Shield and Falling Warrior  These were rare L examples of Moore s use of the male figure and owe something to his visit to Greece in     when he had the opportunity to study ancient works of art  In his final years  Moore created the Henry Moore Foundation to promote art appreciation and   to display his work  Moore was the first modern English sculptor to achieve international critical acclaim and he is still regarded as one of the most important sculptors of the th century      i          t Eo    " "X Test  r Questions     Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage   E In boxes

Desolenator  producing clean water      Q Travelling around Thailand in the s  William Janssen was impressed with the  a ee basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes  where energy from  De the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for domestic use  Two  Ee decades later Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in Southeast Asia into a  D portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water  i B The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from L different places  such as the sea  rivers  boreholes and rain  and purify it for human i consumption  It is particularly valuable in regions where atural groundwater   reserves have been polluted  or where seawater is the only water source available  i Janssen saw that there was a eed for a sustainable way to clean water in both the a developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates   and saw large scale water processing   I was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf ations have because of all of the desalination that they do    E he says      The Desolenator can produce  litres of drinking water per day  enough to sustain   a family for cooking and drinking  Its main selling point is that unlike standard   desalination techniques  it doesn t require a generated power supply  just sunlight  It  measures cm by cm  and is easy to transport  thanks to its two wheels  Water    enters through a pipe  and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing and  the surface of a solar panel  where it is heated by the sun  The warm water flows into   a small boiler  heated by a solar powered battery  where it is converted to steam     When the steam cools  it becomes distilled water  The device has a very simple filter   to trap particles  and this can easily be shaken to remove them  There are two tubes    for liquid coming out  one for the waste   salt from seawater  fluoride  etc    and another for the distilled water  The performance of the unit is shown on an LCD    screen and transmitted to the company which provides servicing when ecessary     DA recent analysis found that at least two thirds of the world s population lives  b with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year  Janssen says that by     half of the world s population will be living with water stress   where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time   It is really important that   a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people      he says  Many countries  don t have the money for desalination plants  which are    very expensive to build  They don t have the money to operate them  they are very    maintenance intensive  and they don t have the money to buy the diesel to run the    desalination plants  so it is a really bad situation    i           " "X Test   E The device is aimed at a wide variety of users   from homeowners in the developing   world who do ot have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US  The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected   to be in operation in India early ext year  after field tests are carried out  The market for the self sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold   those who cannot i afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance  and middle    income homes that can lease their own equipment   People in India don t pay fora fridge outright  they pay for it over six months  They would put the Desolenator on   their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis   Janssen says  In the developed world  it is aimed   at iche markets where tap water is unavailable   for camping  on boats  or for the   military  for instance     F Prices will vary according to where it is bought  In the developing world  the price i will depend on what deal aid organisations can egotiate  In developed countries  it   is likely to come in at        a unit  said Janssen   We are a venture with a   social mission  We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing world and humanitarian sector and that this is the way we will proceed  We do realise  though  that to be a viable company there is a bottom   line to keep in mind  he says     G The company itself is based at Imperial College London  although Janssen  its chief executive  still lives in the UAE  It bas raised    in funding so far  Within two years  he says  the company aims to be selling   units a month  mainly in the   humanitarian field  They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia  orthern Chile

    READING PASSAGE  i      i You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading   Passage  below    E   v Why fairy tales are really scary tales     e u Some people think that fairy tales are just stories to amuse children  but their   d universal and enduring appeal may be due to more serious reasons   p People of every culture tell each other fairy tales but the same story often takes a variety of forms   o in different parts of the world  In the story of Little Red Riding Hood that European children are   al familiar with  a young girl on the way to see her grandmother meets a wolf and tells him where    i she is going  The wolf runs on ahead and disposes of the grandmother  then gets into bed dressed   in the grandmother s clothes to wait for Little Red Riding Hood  You may think you know the   r story   but which version  In some versions  the wolf swallows up the grandmother  while in     others it locks her in a cupboard  In some stories Red Riding Hood gets the better of the wolfon a her own  while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her cries and comes to her rescue     The universal appeal of these tales is frequently attributed to the idea that they contain cautionary   messages  in the case of Little Red Riding Hood  to listen to your mother  and avoid talking   w to strangers   It might be what we find interesting about this story is that it s got this survival    Ps relevant information in it  says anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham University in the UK    Ie But his research suggests otherwise   We have this huge gap in our knowledge about the history   a and prehistory of storytelling  despite the fact that we know this genre is an incredibly ancient   th one   he says  That hasn t stopped anthropologists  folklorists  and other academics devising f eo theories to explain the importance of fairy tales in human society  Now Tehrani has founda way   ve to test these ideas  borrowing a technique from evolutionary biologists  i cf To work out the evolutionary history  development and relationships among groups of organisms  M biologists compare the characteristics of living species in a process called  phylogenetic analysis   an Tehrani has used the same approach to compare related versions of fairy tales to discover how   de they have evolved and which elements have survived longest   it Tehrani s analysis focused on Little Red Riding Hood in its many forms  which include another   e Western fairy tale known as The Wolf and the Kids  Checking for variants of these two tales and similar stories from Africa  East Asia and other regions  he ended up with  stories recorded   from oral traditions  Once his phylogenetic analysis had established that they were indeed related  he used the same methods to explore how they have developed and altered over time  First he tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story alter least as it evolves  indicating their importance  Folklorists believe that what happens in a story is more central to the story than the characters in it   that visiting a relative  only to be met by a scary animal in disguise  is  Folilorists  those who study traditional stories   " "X a   Reading      more fundamental than whether the visitor is a little girl or three siblings  or the animal is a tiger   instead of a wolf        However  Tehrani found o significant difference in the rate of evolution of incidents compared      with that of characters   Certain episodes are very stable because they are crucial to the story  but       there are lots of other details that can evolve quite freely  he says  Neither did his analysis support     the theory that the central section of a story is the most conserved part  He found o significant    difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the beginning or the end      But the really big surprise came when he looked at the cautionary elements of the story   Studies Fon hunter gatherer folk tales suggest that these arratives include really important information    about the environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there   stuff that s relevant    to survival   he says  Yet in his analysis such elements were just as flexible as seemingly trivial     details  What  then  is important enough to be reproduced from generation to generation     The answer  it would appear  is fear   blood thirsty and gruesome aspects of the story  such as the   eating of the grandmother by the wolf  turned out to be the best preserved of all  Why are these   details retained by generations of storytellers  when other features are ot  Tehrani has an idea      In an oral context  a story won t survive because of one great teller  It also eeds to be interesting when it s told by someone who s ot ecessarily a great storyteller   Maybe being swallowed whole by a wolf  then cut out of its stomach alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain   popular  o matter how badly it s told    Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota  Minneapolis  is unconvinced by Tehrani s views on fairy tales   Even if they re gruesome  they won t stick unless they matter   he says  He believes the perennial theme of women as victims in stories like Little Red Riding Hood explains why they continue to feel relevant  But Tehrani points out that although this is often the case in Western   versions  it is ot always true elsewhere  In Chinese and Japanese versions  often known as The Tiger Grandmother  the villain is a woman  and in both Iran and Nigeria  the victim is a boy    Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University in Denmark isn t surprised by Tehrani s findings   Habits   and morals change  but the things that scare us  and the fact that we seek out entertainment that s designed to scare us    those are constant   he says  Clasen believes that scary stories teach us what   it feels like to be afraid without having to experience real danger  and so build up resistance to negative emotions  i   I   " "X Test  r       Questions     Complete each sentence with the correct ending  A F  below  Write the correct letter  A F  in boxes

Passage  below    The return of the huarango The arid valleys of southern Peru are welcoming   the return of a ative plant The south coast of Peru is a arrow    kilometre long strip of desert squeezed between the i Andes and the Pacific Ocean  It is also one of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth  It hardly ever rains there  and the only year round source of water is located tens of metres below the surface  This is why the huarango tree is so suited to life there  it has the longest roots of any tree in the world  They stretch down   metres and  as well as sucking up water for the tree  they bring it   into the higher subsoil  creating a water source for other plant life  i Dr David Beresford Jones  archaeobotanist at Cambridge University  has been studying the role   of the huarango tree in landscape change in the Lower Ica Vailey in southern Peru  He believes i the huarango was key to the ancient people s diet and  because it could reach deep water sources    it allowed local people to withstand years of drought when their other crops failed  But over the E centuries huarango trees were gradually replaced with crops  Cutting down ative woodland leads to erosion  as there is othing to keep the soil in place  So when the huarangos go  the land turns i into a desert  Nothing grows at all in the Lower Ica Valley ow    For centuries the huarango tree was vital to the people of the eighbouring Middle Ica Valley   too  They grew vegetables under it and ate products made from its seed pods  Its leaves and bark were used for herbal remedies  while its branches were used for charcoal for cooking and heating    and its trunk was used to build houses  But ow it is disappearing rapidly  The majority of the   huarango forests in the valley have already been cleared for fuel and agriculture   initially  these were smallholdings  but ow they re huge farms producing crops for the international market     Of the forests that were here   years ago   per cent have already gone   says botanist Oliver Whaley from Kew Gardens in London  who  together with ethnobotanist Dr William Milliken    is running a pioneering project to protect and restore the rapidly disappearing habitat  In order to succeed  Whaley eeds to get the local people on board  and that has meant overcoming local prejudices   Increasingly aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your home or street  it shows you are poor  and still eed to grow your own food   he says  In order to stop the Middle Ica Valley going the same way as the Lower Ica Valley  Whaley is encouraging locals to love the huarangos again   It s a process of cultural resuscitation   he says  He has already set up a huarango festival to reinstate a sense of pride in their eco heritage  and has helped local schoolchildren plant thousands of trees      " "X Lo Reading D L  Jn order to get people interested in habitat restoration  you eed to plant a tree that is useful to      them   says Whaley  So  he has been working with local families to attempt to create a sustainable  income from the huarangos by turning their products into foodstuffs   Boil up the beans and you LL get this thick brown syrup like molasses  You can also use it in drinks  soups or stews   The pods      can be ground into flour to make cakes  and the seeds roasted into a sweet  chocolatey  coffee     b   It s packed full of vitamins and minerals   Whaley says     And some farmers are already planting huarangos  Alberto Benevides  owner of Ica Valley s only      certified organic farm  which Whaley helped set up  has been planting the tree for  years  He   produces syrup and flour  and selis these products at an organic farmers  market in Lima  His      farm is relatively small and doesn t yet provide him with enough to live on  but he hopes this   will change   The organic market is growing rapidly in Peru   Benevides says   I am investing in   the future    But even if Whaley can convince the local people to fall in love with the huarango again  there is    still the threat of the larger farms  Some of these cut across the forests and break up the corridors   that allow the essential movement of mammals  birds and pollen up and down the arrow forest     strip  In the hope of counteracting this  he s persuading farmers to let him plant forest corridors   on their land  He believes the extra woodland will also benefit the farms by reducing their water d   usage through a lowering of evaporation and providing a refuge for bio control insects  i  If we can record biodiversity and see how it all works  then we re in a good position to move on from there  Desert habitats can reduce down to very little   Whaley explains   It s ot like a FE rainforest that eeds to have this huge expanse  Life has always been confined to corridors and islands here  If you just have a few trees left  the population can grow up quickly because it s used to exploiting water when it arrives   He sees his project as a model that has the potential to E be rolled out across other arid areas around the world   If we can do it here  in the most fragile system on Earth  then that s a real message of hope for lots of places  including Africa  where E there is drought and they just can t afford to wait for rain     " "X Test   Questions     Complete the otes below  Choose ONE WORD ONLY from the passage

one of the Canary Islands situated in the Atlantic Ocean off the orthwest coast of Africa  This small volcanic island is mountainous  with steep rocky slopes and deep  wooded ravines  rising to   metres at its highest peak  It is also home to the best known of the world s whistle  languages   a means of transmitting information over long distances which is perfectly adapted to the extreme terrain of the island  I This  language   known as  Silbo  or  Silbo Gomero    from the Spanish word for  whistle    is ow shedding light on the language processing abilities of the human brain  according to scientists  Researchers say that Silbo activates parts of the brain ormally associated with spoken f language  suggesting that the brain is remarkably fiexible in its ability to interpret sounds as language   Science has developed the idea of brain areas that are dedicated to language  and we are starting to understand the scope of signals that can be recognised as language  says David Corina  co author of a recent study and associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle  I Silbo is a substitute for Spanish  with individual words recoded into whistles which have high    and low frequency tones  A whistler   or silbador   puts a finger in his or her mouth to increase   the whistle s pitch  while the other hand can be cupped to adjust the direction of the sound   There   is much more ambiguity in the whistled signal than in the spoken signal   explains lead researcher i Manuel Carreiras  psychology professor at the University of La Laguna on the Canary island of   Tenerife  Because whistled  words  can be hard to distinguish  silbadores rely on repetition  as i well as awareness of context  to make themselves understood    The silbadores of Gomera are traditionally shepherds and other isolated mountain folk  and   their ovel means of staying in touch allows them to communicate over distances of up to i  kilometres  Carreiras explains that silbadores are able to pass a surprising amount of   information via their whistles   In daily life they use whistles to communicate short commands    but any Spanish sentence could be whistled   Silbo has proved particularly useful when fires have occurred on the island and rapid communication across large areas has been vital  i  i  " "X  Reading    The study team used euroimaging equipment to contrast the brain activity of silbadores while     listening to whistled and spoken Spanish  Results showed the left temporal lobe of the brain    which is usually associated with spoken language  was engaged during the processing of Silbo    a The researchers found that other key regions in the brain s frontal lobe also responded to the   be whistles  including those activated in response to sign language among deaf people  When the  a    experiments were repeated with on whistlers  however  activation was observed in all areas of   the brain   hb  Our results provide more evidence about the flexibility of human capacity for language in a     variety of forms   Corina says   These data suggest that left hemisphere language regions are     uniquely adapted for communicative purposes  independent of the modality of signal  The on     Silbo speakers were ot recognising Silbo as a language  They had othing to grab onto  so      multiple areas of their brains were activated    A Carreiras says the origins of Silbo Gomero remain obscure  but that indigenous Canary Islanders      who were of North African origin  already had a whistled language when Spain conquered the   volcanic islands in the th century  Whistled languages survive today in Papua New Guinea   Ab Mexico  Vietnam  Guyana  China  Nepal  Senegal  and a few mountainous pockets in southern  ap Europe  There are thought to be as many as  whistled languages still in use  though only   ab have been described and studied scientifically  This form of communication is an adaptation found among cultures where people are often isolated from each other  according to Julien     Meyer  a researcher at the Institute of Human Sciences in Lyon  France   They are mostly used in  mountains or dense forests  he says   Whistled languages are quite clearly defined and represent    an original adaptation of the spoken language for the eeds of isolated human groups   But with modern communication technology ow widely available  researchers say whistled languages like Silbo are threatened with extinction  With dwindling umbers of Gomera islanders still fluent in the language  Canaries  authorities are taking steps to try to ensure its survival  Since   Silbo Gomero has been taught in all of the island s elementary schools  In addition  locals are seeking assistance from the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  UNESCO    The local authorities are trying to get an award from the organisation to declare  Silbo Gomero  as something that should be preserved for humanity  Carreiras adds     " "X     Test  al       Questions       Do the failowing statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage     in boxes   on your answer sheet  write TRUE if

   Test  ay READING PASSAGE    You should spend about  minutes on Questions    which are based on Reading Passage  below  Environmental practices of big businesses The environmental practices of big businesses are shaped by a fundamental fact that for many of us offends our sense of justice  Depending on the circumstances  a business may maximize the amount of money it makes  at least in the short term  by damaging the environment and hurting people  That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas  and for international logging companies with short term leases on tropical rainforest land in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners  When government regulation is effective  and   when the public is environmentally aware  environmentally clean big businesses may out compete dirty ones  but the reverse is likely to be true if government regulation is ineffective and if the   public doesn t care  It is easy for the rest of us to blame a business for helping itself by hurting other people  But blaming alone is unlikely to produce change  It ignores the fact that businesses are ot charities but profit making companies  and that publicly owned companies with shareholders are under obligation to those shareholders to maximize profits  provided that they do so by legal means  US laws make a company s directors legally liable for something termed  breach of fiduciary responsibility  if they knowingly manage a company in a way that reduces profits  The car manufacturer Henry Ford was in fact successfully sued by shareholders in  for raising the minimum wage of his workers to   per day  the courts declared that  while Ford s humanitarian sentiments about his employees were ice  his business existed to make profits for its stockholders    Our blaming of businesses also ignores the ultimate responsibility of the public for creating the conditions that let a business profit through destructive environmental policies  In the long run  it is the public  either directly or through its politicians  that has the power to make such destructive policies unprofitable and illegal  and to make sustainable environmental policies profitable    The public can do that by suing businesses for harming them  as happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster  in which over   m  of oil were spilled off the coast of Alaska  The public may also   make their opinion felt by preferring to buy sustainably harvested products  by making employees   of companies with poor track records feel ashamed of their company and complain to their own   management  by preferring their governments to award valuable contracts to businesses with a good environmental track record  and by pressing their governments to pass and enforce laws and regulations requiring good environmental practices       eae Be  " "X Reading In turn  big businesses can exert powerful pressure on any suppliers that might ignore public   or government pressure  For instance  after the US public became concerned about the spread   ofa disease known as BSE  which was transmitted to humans through infected meat  the US   government s Food and Drug Administration introduced rules demanding that the meat industry    abandon practices associated with the risk of the disease spreading  But for five years the meat Co packers tefused to follow these  claiming that they would be too expensive to obey  However  LL when a major fast food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its  hamburgers plummeted  the meat industry complied within weeks  The public s task is therefore b to identify which links in the supply chain are sensitive to public pressure  for instance  fast food     chains or jewelry stores  but ot meat packers or gold miners  be    Some readers may be disappointed or outraged that I place the ultimate responsibility for business     practices harming the public on the public itself   also believe that the public must accept the    ecessity for higher prices for products to cover the added costs  if any  of sound environmental    practices  My views may seem to ignore the belief that businesses should act in accordance with   moral principles even if this leads to a reduction in their profits  But I think we have to recognize   that  throughout human history  in ail politically complex human societies  government regulation     has arisen precisely because it was found that ot only did moral principles eed to be made    explicit  they also eeded to be enforced  L To me  the conclusion that the public has the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the    biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful  rather than disappointing  My conclusion is ot a b moralistic one about who is right or wrong  admirable or selfish  a good guy or a bad guy  In the E past  businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior  to E reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted  and to make things difficult for businesses    practicing behaviors that the public didn t want  I predict that in the future  just as in the past

Passage  below 
Nutmeg ï¿½ a valuable spice
The nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia  Until the late
th century, it only grew in one place in the world: a small group of islands in the Banda Sea, part
of the Mohuceas ï¿½ or Spice Islands ï¿½ in northeastern Indonesia  The tree is thickly branched with
dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, and produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers and
pale yellow pear-shaped fruits  The fruit is encased in a fleshy husk, When the fruit is ripe, this husk
splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit  Inside is a purple-brown shiny seed,
- cm long by about cm across, surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an ï¿½arilï¿½  These
are the sources of the two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced from the dried seed
and the Jatter from the aril 
Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages, and was
used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent  Throughout this period, the Arabs were the
exclusive importers of the spice to Europe  They sold nutmeg for high prices to merchants ï¿½based in
Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity,
i The Arab-Venetian dominance of the trade finally ended in , when the Portuguese reached the
Banda Islands and began exploiting its precious resources 
Always in danger of competition from neighbouring Spain, the Portuguese began subcontracting
their spice distribution to Dutch traders  Profits began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch
| commercial fleet swiftly grew into one of the largest in the world  The Dutch quietly gained control
i of most of the shipping and trading of spices in Northern Europe  Then, in , Portugal fell under
Spanish rule, and by the end of the th century the Dutch found themselves locked out of the market 
As prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back 
f In , Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East
India Company  By , the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world  The company
| had , employees worldwide, with a private army of , men and a fleet of  ships  At
the same time, thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague, a highly contagious and
deadly disease  Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they decided
nutmeg held the cure  Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to
have it  Nutmeg bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for , times its original cost
on the streets of London  The only problem was the short supply  And thatï¿½s where the Dutch found
| their opportunity 

" " Reading
a ï¿½The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a neutral trading
De policy towards foreign powers  This allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish
|  troops on their soil, but it also left them unprotected from other invaders  In , the Dutch
arrived and took over  Once securely in control of the Bandas, the Dutch went to work protecting
their new investment  They concentrated all nutmeg production into a few easily guarded areas,
co uprooting and destroying any trees outside the plantation zones  Anyone caught growing a nutmeg
|  seedling or carrying seeds without the proper authority was severely punished  In addition,
'  all exported nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a fertile seed
ï¿½which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands  There was only one obstacle to Dutch

Passage  below 

Driverless cars

A The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in manufacturing 
The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the s onwards led to
significant cost savings and improvements in the reliability and flexibility of vehicle
mass production  A new challenge to vehicle production is now on the horizon
and, again, it comes from automation  However, this time it is not to do with the
manufacturing process, but with the vehicles themselves 

Research projects on vehicle automation are not new  Vehicies with limited self-
driving capabilities have been around for more than  years, resulting in significant
contributions towards driver assistance systems  But since Google announced in
 that it had been trialling self-driving cars on the streets of California, progress
in this field has quickly gathered pace 

B There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast  One frequently cited
motive is safety; indeed, research at the UKï¿½s Transport Research Laboratory has
demonstrated that more than  percent of road collisions involve human error as a
contributory factor, and it is the primary cause in the vast majority  Automation may
help to reduce the incidence of this 

Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes  if the
vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be productive, to
socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe
control of the vehicle  If the vehicle can do the driving, those who are challenged
by existing mobility models ï¿½ such as older or disabled travellers ï¿½ may be able to
enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy 

C Beyond these direct benefits, we can consider the wider implications for transport
and society, and how manufacturing processes might need to respond as a

result  At present, the average car spends more than  percent of its life parked 

Automation means that initiatives for car-sharing become much more viable,

particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand  If a significant proportion

of the population choose to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand can
be met by far fewer vehicles 

D The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated mobility in
Singapore, finding that fewer than  percent of the vehicles currently used would
be required if fully automated car sharing could be implemented  If this is the case,
it might mean that we need to manufacture far fewer vehicles to meet demand 


" "oe Reading
: However, the number of trips being taken would probably increase, partly because
: empty vehicles would have to be moved from one customer to the next 
Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute
| suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by  percent, but
 that vehiclesï¿½ average annual mileage would double as a result  As a consequence,
z each vehicie would be used more intensively, and might need replacing
a sooner  This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle production will not
J necessarily decrease 
/ ï¿½ Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture  If we move to a
a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but to purchase
  access to a range of vehicles through a mobility provider, drivers will have the
 freedom to select one that best suits their needs for a particular journey, rather than
A making a compromise across all their requirements 
i Since, for most of the time, most of the seats in most cars are unoccupied, this may
: boost production of a smaller, more efficient range of vehicles that suit the needs
: of individuals  Specialised vehicles may then be available for exceptional journeys,
such as going on a family camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to
: university 
: F There are a number of hurdies to overcome in delivering automated vehicles
j to our roads  These include the technical difficulties in ensuring that the vehicle
  works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather and road situations it might
: encounter; the regulatory challenges in understanding how liability and enforcement
: might change when drivers are no longer essential for vehicle operation; and
the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept
: automated vehicles as being a valuable part of the mobility landscape 
: G itï¿½s clear that there are many challenges that need to be addressed but, through
: robust and targeted research, these can most probably be conquered within the
next  years  Mobility will change in such potentially significant ways and in
association with so many other technological developments, such as telepresence
i and virtual reality, that it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future 
However, one thing is certain: change is coming, and the need to be flexible in
response to this will be vital for those involved in manufacturing the vehicles that
will deliver future mobility

Passage  below 
What is exploration? |
ï¿½We are all explorers  Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part :
of what makes us human ï¿½ indeed, this has played an important part in our success as a species 
Long before the first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there were :
plenty of wildebeest over yonder, our ancestors had learnt the value of sending out scouts to :
investigate the unknown  This questing nature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread :
around the globe, just as it nowadays no doubt helps the last nomadic Penan maintain their
existence in the depleted forests of Borneo, and a visitor negotiate the subways of New York  
Over the years, weï¿½ve come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed ï¿½ different from the rest of
us, different from those of us who are merely ï¿½well travelledï¿½, even; and perhaps there is a type of
person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out 
That, however, doesnï¿½t take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today;
and that in all sorts of professions ï¿½ whether artist, marine biologist or astronomer ï¿½ borders of
the unknown are being tested each day 
Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of uncultivated land, and :
used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters  He is delving into matters 
we all recognise because they are common to humanity  This is surely an act of exploration, and :
into a world as remote as the author chooses, Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of
the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones  The
traveller ï¿½who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling
Jaboriously over a country in which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his
other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain peopleï¿½ 
In this book about the exploration of the earthï¿½s surface, I have confined myself to those whose
travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery  But that still left me with
another problem: the word ï¿½explorerï¿½ has become associated with a past era  We think back to a
golden  age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the th century ï¿½ as if the process of discovery
is now on the decline, though the truth is that we have named only one and a half million of this
planetï¿½s species, and there may be more than  million ï¿½ and thatï¿½s not including bacteria  We
have studied only  per cent of the species we know  We have scarcely mapped  the ocean floors,
and know even less about ourselves; we fully understand the workings of only  per cent of our
brains 
  
" "| Reading
- Here is how some of todayï¿½s ï¿½explorersï¿½ define the word  Ran Fiennes, dubbed the ï¿½greatest
: living explorerï¿½, said, ï¿½An explorer is someone who has done something that no human has done
\ before - and also done something scientifically useful ï¿½ Chris Bonington, a leading mountaineer,
felt exploration was to be found in the act of physically touching the unknown: ï¿½You have to
, have gone somewhere new ï¿½ Then Robin Hanbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote
e so-called ï¿½tribalï¿½ peoples, said, ï¿½A traveller simply records information about some far-off world,
i and reports back; but an explorer changes the world ï¿½ Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabiaï¿½s
c Empty Quarter in , and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us,
  told me, ï¿½If I'd gone across by camel when I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt ï¿½
 To him, exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great
' self-discovery 
: Each definition is slightly different -- and tends to refiect the field of endeavour of each pioneer  It
| was the same whoever J asked: the prominent historian would say exploration was a thing of the
a past, the cutting-edge scientist would say it was of the present  And so on  They each set their own
] particular criteria; the common factor in their approach being that they all had, unlike many of us
| who simply enjoy travel or discovering new things, both a very definite objective from the outset
 and also a desire to record their findings 
: I'd best declare my own bias  As a writer, Iï¿½m interested in the exploration of ideas  Iï¿½ve done
| a great many expeditions and each one was unique  Iï¿½ve lived for months alone with isolated
: groups of people all around the world, even two ï¿½uncontacted tribesï¿½  But none of these things
| is of the slightest interest to anyone unless, through my books, Iï¿½ve found a new slant, explored
: anew idea  Why? Because the world has moved on  The time has long passed for the great
: continental voyages ï¿½ another walk to the poles, another crossing of the Empty Quarter  We
: know how the Jand surface of our planet lies; exploration of it is now down to the details ï¿½ the
: habits of microbes, say, or the grazing behaviour of buffalo  Aside from the deep sea and deep
: underground, itï¿½s the era of specialists  However, this is to disregard the role the human mind has
: in conveying remote places; and this is what interests me: how a fresh interpretation, even of a
well-travelled route, can give its readers new insights

Pe Could urban engineers learn from dance?
| A The way we travel around cities has a major impact on whether they are sustainable 
Le Transportation is estimated to account for % of energy consumption in most of the
ce worldï¿½s most developed nations, so lowering the need for energy-using vehicles is essential
c for decreasing the environmental impact of mobility, But as more and more people move to
a cities, it is important to think about other kinds of sustainable travel too  The ways we travel
a affect our physical and mental health, our social lives, our access to work and culture, and
| the ait we breathe  Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities through
  urban design, but the engineering industry still works on the assumptions that led to the
L creation of the energy-consuming transport systems we have now: the emphasis placed
i solely on efficiency, speed, and quantitative data  We need radical changes, to make it
: healthier, more enjoyable, and less environmentally damaging to travel around cities 
: B Dance might hold some of the answers  That is not to suggest everyone should dance their
: way to work, however healthy and happy it might make us, but rather that the techniques
i used by choreographers to experiment with and design movement in dance could provide
' engineers with tools to stimulate new ideas in city-making  Richard Sennett, an influential
: urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about the way cities are made,
: argues that urban design has suffered from a separation between mind and body since the
' introduction of the architectural blueprint 
: C Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate
: knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, building designs
: are now conceived and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the
: physical and social realities they are creating  While the design practices created by these
: new technologies are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city,
: they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process 
  D To illustrate, Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, USA, a development typical
: of the modernist approach to urban planning prevalent in the s  Peachtree created a grid
of streets and towers intended as a new pedestrian-friendly downtown for Atlanta  According
to Sennett, this failed because its designers had invested too much faith in computer-aided
: design to tell them how it would operate  They failed to take into account that purpose-built
i street cafï¿½s could not operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older
buildings, and would need energy-consuming air conditioning instead, or that its giant car
park would feel so unwelcoming that it would put people off getting out of their cars  What
seems entirely predictable and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated
into reality 
: 
" "Test  -

E The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to predict and shape the  
way people move through the city  Again, these models are necessary, but they are built
on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered e
and other experiences of the city ignored  Designs that seem logical in models appear i
counter-intuitive in the actual experience of their users  The guard rails that will be familiar
to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road, for example, were an engineering  
solution to pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of traffic  On  :
wide major roads, they often guide pedestrians to specific crossing points and slow down A
their progress across the road by using staggered access points to divide the crossing into  
two ï¿½ one for each carriageway  In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing :
psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile, and encouraging :
others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails, These barriers donï¿½t -
just make it harder to cross the road: they divide communities and decrease opportunities :
for healthy transport  As a result, many are now being removed, causing disruption, cost, :
and waste  :

F If their designers had had the tools to think with their bodies ï¿½ like dancers ï¿½ and imagine S
how these barriers would feel, there might have been a better solution  In order to bring  
about fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities, engineering will need to develop :
a richer understanding of why people move in certain ways, and how this movement affects Q
them  Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem  Yet it shares
with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space  
It is an art form developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body, and gaining ï¿½
instant feedback on how the results feel  Choreographers have deep understanding of the
psychological, aesthetic, and physical implications of different ways of moving 

G = Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor, cognitive scientist David Kirsh described
how he ï¿½thinks with the bodyï¿½  Kirsh argues that by using the body to simulate outcomes,
McGregor is able to imagine solutions that would not be possible using purely abstract
thought  This kind of physical knowledge is valued in many areas of expertise, but currently
has no place in formal engineering design processes  A suggested method for transport
engineers is to improvise design solutions and get instant feedback about how they
would work from their own experience of them, or model designs at full scale in the way
choreographers experiment with groups of dancers  Above all, perhaps, they might learn to
design for emotional as well as functional effects

Passage  below  :
Should we try to bring extinct species back to life? :
A  The passenger pigeon was a legendary species  Flying in vast numbers across :
North America, with potentially many millions within a single flock, their migration
was once one of natureï¿½s great spectacles  Sadly, the passenger pigeonï¿½s existence
came to an end on  September , when the last living specimen died at :
Cincinnati Zoo  Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project
which now aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as ï¿½de-
extinctionï¿½  The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of
extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still
in existence ï¿½ in this case, the abundant band-tailed pigeon ï¿½ before being born as
a living, breathing animal  Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in
this field, but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting-edge technology
is being trialled 
B In Australia, the thylacine, more commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, is
another extinct creature which genetic scientists are striving to bring back to life 
ï¿½There is no carnivore now in Tasmania that fills the niche which thylacines once
occupied,ï¿½ explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales  He points
out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in
a ï¿½dangerously debilitatingï¿½ facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence
of the Tasmanian devils, the islandï¿½s other notorious resident  Thylacines would
i have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers
| of Tasmanian devils  ï¿½If that contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would
i have burned out in whatever region it started  The return of thylacines to Tasmania
/ could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind ï¿½
C If extinct species can be brought back to life, can humanity begin to correct the
damage it has caused to the natural world over the past few millennia? ï¿½The idea
of de-extinction is that we can reverse this process, bringing species that no
longer exist back to life,ï¿½ says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruzï¿½s
Genomics Institute  ï¿½I donï¿½t think that we can do this  There is no way to bring
back something that is  per cent identical to a species that went extinct a long
time ago ï¿½ A more practical approach for long-extinct species is to take the DNA of
existing species as a template, ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal
DNA to create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which
looks and/or acts like the animal which died out 

" "a Reading
| p  This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question: what is
  \"= the actual point of this technology? ï¿½For us, the goal has always been replacing
the extinct species with a suitable replacement,ï¿½ expiains Novak  ï¿½When it comes
= > to breeding, band-tailed pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two nests per
hectare, whereas passenger pigeons were very social and would make ,
eo or more nests in one hectare ï¿½ Since the disappearance of this key species,
 ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused
|  by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there
a has been minimal need for regrowth  This has left forests stagnant and therefore
| unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest
/ after a disturbance  According to Novak, a hybridised band-tailed pigeon, with the
a added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that
forest disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a great many other
a native species to thrive 
E Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth  George
a Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth
: Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the main way in which the
| extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ 
| By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the
  icy climate of the tundra, the project's goal is to return mammoths, or a mammoth-
i like species, to the area  ï¿½My highest priority would be preserving the endangered
: Asian elephant,ï¿½ says Church, ï¿½expanding their range to the huge ecosystem of the
  tundra  Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra
insulating fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all traits
i found in the now extinct woolly mammoth ï¿½ This repopulation of the tundra and  
: boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a
: useful factor in reducing carbon emissions ï¿½ elephants punch holes through snow
: and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth  This grass growth would
| reduce temperatures, and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost 
' F While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might capture
' imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an existing species which
: is merely threatened with extinction  ï¿½Many of the technologies that people have
i in mind when they think about de-extinction can be used as a form of ï¿½genetic
: rescueï¿½,ï¿½ explains Shapiro  She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging
 technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in
the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications
i which could prevent mass extinctions in the future  ï¿½I would also say thereï¿½s an
: incredible moral hazard to not do anything at all,ï¿½ she continues  ï¿½We know that
L what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some
' calculated and measured risks ï¿½

You should spend about  minutes on Questions -, which are based on Reading :
Passage  below  :
Having a laugh :
The findings of psychological scientists reveal the importance of humour :
Humans start developing a sense of humour as early as six weeks old, when babies begin to laugh :
and smile in response to stimuli  Laughter is universal across all human cultures and even exisis :
in some form in rats, chimps, and bonobos  Like other human emotions and expressions, laughter
and humour provide psychological scientists with rich resources for studying human psychology, =
ranging from the development of language to the neuroscience of social perception 
Theories focusing on the evolution of laughter point to it as an important adaptation for social
communication  Take, for example, the recorded laughter in TV comedy shows  Back in ,
US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live
audiences, so started recording his own ï¿½laugh tracksï¿½  These were intended to help people at
home feel like they were in a social situation, such as a crowded theatre  Douglass even recorded
various types of laughter, as well as mixtures of laughter from men, women, and children  In
doing so, he picked up on a quality of laughter that is now interesting researchers: a simple ï¿½habaï¿½
communicates a remarkable amount of socially relevant information 
In one study conducted in , samples of laughter from pairs of English-speaking students
were recorded at the University of California, Santa Cruz  A team made up of more than 
psychological scientists, anthropologists, and biologists then played these recordings to listeners
from  diverse societies, from indigenous tribes in New Guinea to city-dwellers in India and
Europe  Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or
strangers  On average, the results were remarkably consistent: worldwide, peopleï¿½s guesses were
correct approximately % of the time 
Researchers have also found that different types of laughter serve as codes to complex human
social hierarchies  A team led by Christopher Oveis from the University of California, San
Diego, found that high-status individuals had different laughs from low-status individuals, and
that strangersï¿½ judgements of an individualï¿½s social, status were influenced by the dominant or
submissive quality of their laughter  In their study,  male college students were randomly
assigned to groups of four, with each group composed of two low-status members, who had just
joined their college fraternity group, and two high-status members, older students who had been 
active in the fraternity for at least two years  Laughter was recorded as each student took a turn
at being teased by the others, involving the use of mildly insulting nicknames  Analysis revealed
that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more dominant laughs and fewer submissive
laughs relative to the low-status individuals  Meanwhile, low-status individuals were more likely
to change their laughter based on their position of power; that is, the newcomers produced more

" " Reading
  dominant laughs when they were in the ï¿½powerfulï¿½ role of teasers  Dominant laughter was higher
a in pitch, louder, and more variable in tone than submissive laughter 
a A random group of volunteers then listened to an equal number of dominant and submissive
laughs from both the high- and low-status individuals, and were asked to estimate the social status
: of the laugher  In line with predictions, laughers producing dominant laughs were perceived to be
E significantly higher in status than laughers producing submissive laughs  ï¿½This was particularly
true for low-status individuals, who were rated as significantly higher in status when displaying a
i dominant versus submissive laugh,ï¿½ Oveis and colleagues note  ï¿½Thus, by strategically displaying
; more dominant laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve higher
: status in the eyes of others ï¿½ However, high-status individuals were rated as high-status whether
: they produced their natural dominant laugh or tried to do a submissive one 
i Another study, conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of Australian National University,
a was based on the hypothesis that humour might provide a respite from tedious situations in the
workplace  This ï¿½mental breakï¿½ might facilitate the replenishment of mental resources  To test this
A theory, the researchers recruited  business students, ostensibly for an experiment on perception 
: First, the students performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance of the
= etter ï¿½eï¿½ over two pages of text  The students then were randomly assigned to watch a video
: clip eliciting either humour, contentment, or neutral feelings  Some watched a clip of the BBC
 comedy Mr  Bean, others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a
| factual video about the management profession 
:
 
| The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess
< the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles, and were told that making
:  correct assessments in a row would lead to a win  However, the software was programmed
| such that it was nearly impossible to achieve  consecutive correct answers  Participants were
 allowed to quit the task at any point  Students who had watched the Mr Bean video ended up
 spending significantly more time working on the task, making twice as many predictions as the
ï¿½ other two groups 
Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study, during which they had
participants complete long multiplication questions by hand  Again, participants who watched the
ï¿½ humorous video spent significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed more
| questions correctly than did the students in either of the other groups 
| ï¿½Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate social relationships, the
traditional view of task performance implies that individuals should avoid things such as humour
+ that may distract them from the accomplishment of task goals,ï¿½ Cheng and Wang conclude  ï¿½We
| Suggest that humour is not only enjoyable but more importantly, energising ï¿½

Passage  below  |
Henry Moore (-) :
The British sculptor Henry Moore was a leading figure :
in the th-century art world |
Henry Moore was born in Castleford, a small town near Leeds in the north of England  He
was the seventh child of Raymond Moore and his wife Mary Baker  Ele studied at Castleford :
Grammar School from  to , where his early interest in art was encouraged by his teacher
Alice Gostick  After leaving school, Moore hoped to become a sculptor, but instead he complied :
with his fatherï¿½s wish that he train as a schoolteacher  He had to abandon his training in 
when he was sent to France to fight in the First World War 
After the war, Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of  Art, where he studied for two years  In his :
first year, he spent most of his time drawing  Although he wanted to study sculpture, no teacher
was appointed until his second year  At the end of that year, he passed the sculpture examination :
and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London, In September , he :
moved to London and began three years of advanced study in sculpture 
Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College, Moore visited many of the London
museums, particularly the British Museum, which had a wide-ranging collection of ancient
sculpture  During these visits, he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and
African sculpture, As he became increasingly interested in these ï¿½primitiveï¿½ forms of art, he
turned away from European sculptural traditions,
After graduating, Moore spent the first six months of  travelling in France  When he visited Q
the Trocadero Museum in Paris, he was impressed by a cast of a Mayanï¿½ sculpture of the rain
spirit  It was a male reclining figure with its knees drawn up together, and its head at a right angle
to its body  Moore became fascinated with this stone sculpture, which he thought had a power
and originality that no other stone sculpture possessed  He himself started carving a variety of
subjects in stone, including depictions of reclining women, mother-and-child groups, and masks 
Mooreï¿½s exceptional talent soon gained recognition, and in  he started work as a sculpture
instructor at the Royal College  In , he became a member of a group of young artists called
Unit One  The aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of the emerging
international movement in modern art and architecture 
\"Mayan: belonging to an ancient civilisation that inhabited parts of current-day Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras 

rata i
" "- Reading
a ground this time, Moore moved away from the human figure to experiment with abstract shapes 
: In , he held an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London  His work was enthusiastically
 welcomed by fellow sculptors, but the reviews in the press were extremely negative and turned
- Moore into a notorious figure  There were calls for his resignation from the Royal College,
eS and the following year, when his contract expired, he left to start a sculpture department at the
: Chelsea School of Art in London 
L Throughout the s, Moore did not show any inclination to please the British public  He
  became interested in the paintings of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, whose work inspired him

t In , Harlow, a town near London, offered Moore a commission for a sculpture depicting
: a family  The resulting work signifies a dramatic change in Mooreï¿½s style, away from the
: experimentation of the s towards a more natural and humanistic subject matter  He did
  dozens of studies in clay for the sculpture, and these were cast in bronze and issued in editions of
seven to nine copies each  In this way, Mooreï¿½s work became available to collectors all over the
: world  The boost to his income enabled him to take on ambitious projects and start working on
C the scale he felt his sculpture demanded 
| Critics who had begun to think that Moore had become less revolutionary were proven wrong
: by the appearance, in , of the first of Mooreï¿½s series of standing figures in bronze, with their
| harsh and anguiar pierced forms and distinct impression of menace  Moore also varied his subject
| matter in the s with such works as Warrior with Shield and Falling Warrior  These were rare
L examples of Mooreï¿½s use of the male figure and owe something to his visit to Greece in ,
: when he had the opportunity to study ancient works of art 
In his final years, Moore created the Henry Moore Foundation to promote art appreciation and

a The Desolenator: producing clean water

| -ï¿½Q Travelling around Thailand in the s, William Janssen was impressed with the

a ee basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes, where energy from

De the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for domestic use  Two

Ee decades later Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in Southeast Asia into a

D portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water 
i B The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from
L different places, such as the sea, rivers, boreholes and rain, and purify it for human
i consumption  It is particularly valuable in regions where natural groundwater
| reserves have been polluted, or where seawater is the only water source available 
i Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water in both the
a developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates
| and saw large-scale water processing  ï¿½I was confronted with the enormous carbon
footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do,ï¿½

E he says 
| ï¿½ The Desolenator can produce  litres of drinking water per day, enough to sustain
| a family for cooking and drinking  Its main selling point is that unlike standard
  desalination techniques, it doesnï¿½t require a generated power supply: just sunlight  It
 measures cm by cm, and is easy to transport, thanks to its two wheels  Water

: enters through a pipe, and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing and
 the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by the sun  The warm water flows into
ï¿½ a small boiler (heated by a solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam 

| When the steam cools, it becomes distilled water  The device has a very simple filter
: to trap particles, and this can easily be shaken to remove them, There are two tubes

: for liquid coming out: one for the waste ï¿½ salt from seawater, fluoride, etc  ï¿½ and
another for the distilled water  The performance of the unit is shown on an LCD

| screen and transmitted to the company which provides servicing when necessary 

: DA recent analysis found that at least two-thirds of the worldï¿½s population lives

b with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year  Janssen says that by

:  half of the worldï¿½s population will be living with water stress ï¿½ where the
demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time  ï¿½It is really important that
| a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people,ï¿½

: he says  Many countries ï¿½donï¿½t have the money for desalination plants, which are

| very expensive to build  They donï¿½t have the money to operate them, they are very

/ maintenance intensive, and they donï¿½t have the money to buy the diesel to run the

: desalination plants, so it is a really bad situation ï¿½

E The device is aimed at a wide variety of users ï¿½ from homeowners in the developing :
world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in
rural parts of the US  The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected :
to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out  The market
for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold ï¿½ those who cannot i
afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance, and middle- |
income homes that can lease their own equipment  ï¿½People in India donï¿½t pay fora
fridge outright; they pay for it over six months  They would put the Desolenator on :
their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very reliable
drinking water on a daily basis,ï¿½ Janssen says  In the developed world, it is aimed :
at niche markets where tap water is unavailable ~ for camping, on boats, or for the :
military, for instance  &

F Prices will vary according to where it is bought  In the developing world, the price i
will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate  In developed countries, it :
is likely to come in at $, (ï¿½) a unit, said Janssen  ï¿½We are a venture with a :
social mission  We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding
application in the developing world and humanitarian sector and that this is the way
we will proceed  We do realise, though, that to be a viable company there is a bottom |
line to keep in mind, he says  :

executive, still lives in the UAE  It bas raised ï¿½, in funding so far  Within two

Passage  below  - E
& v
Why fairy tales are really scary tales : ï¿½
e u
Some people think that fairy tales are just stories to amuse children, but their : d
universal and enduring appeal may be due to more serious reasons : p
People of every culture tell each other fairy tales but the same story often takes a variety of forms : o
in different parts of the world  In the story of Little Red Riding Hood that European children are | al
familiar with, a young girl on the way to see her grandmother meets a wolf and tells him where   ï¿½i
she is going  The wolf runs on ahead and disposes of the grandmother, then gets into bed dressed :
in the grandmotherï¿½s clothes to wait for Little Red Riding Hood  You may think you know the : r
story ~ but which version? In some versions, the wolf swallows up the grandmother, while in ï¿½ :
others it locks her in a cupboard  In some stories Red Riding Hood gets the better of the wolfon a
her own, while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her cries and comes to her rescue  / 
The universal appeal of these tales is frequently attributed to the idea that they contain cautionary ï¿½
messages: in the case of Little Red Riding Hood, to listen to your mother, and avoid talking   w
to strangers  ï¿½It might be what we find interesting about this story is that itï¿½s got this survival- : Ps
relevant information in it, says anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham University in the UK  : Ie
But his research suggests otherwise  ï¿½We have this huge gap in our knowledge about the history : a
and prehistory of storytelling, despite the fact that we know this genre is an incredibly ancient ' th
one,ï¿½ he says  That hasn't stopped anthropologists, folkloristsï¿½ and other academics devising f eo
theories to explain the importance of fairy tales in human society  Now Tehrani has founda way | ve
to test these ideas, borrowing a technique from evolutionary biologists  i cf
To work out the evolutionary history, development and relationships among groups of organisms, M
biologists compare the characteristics of living species in a process called ï¿½phylogenetic analysisï¿½  an
Tehrani has used the same approach to compare related versions of fairy tales to discover how : de
they have evolved and which elements have survived longest   it
Tehraniï¿½s analysis focused on Little Red Riding Hood in its many forms, which include another : ne
Western fairy tale known as The Wolf and the Kids  Checking for variants of these two tales and
similar stories from Africa, East Asia and other regions, he ended up with  stories recorded :
from oral traditions  Once his phylogenetic analysis had established that they were indeed related,
he used the same methods to explore how they have developed and altered over time 
First he tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story alter least as it evolves, indicating
their importance  Folklorists believe that what happens in a story is more central to the story
than the characters in it ï¿½ that visiting a relative, only to be met by a scary animal in disguise, is
ï¿½Folilorists: those who study traditional stories

" "a   Reading
|  ï¿½ more fundamental than whether the visitor is a little'girl or three siblings, or the animal is a tiger
| instead of a wolf 
=|) ï¿½ However, Tehrani found no significant difference in the rate of evolution of incidents compared
  >> with that of characters  ï¿½Certain episodes are very stable because they are crucial to the story, but
; - < there are lots of other details that can evolve quite freely, he says  Neither did his analysis support
+ ï¿½ the theory that the central section of a story is the most conserved part  He found no significant
ï¿½| difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the beginning or the end 
|   But the really big surprise came when he looked at the cautionary elements of the story  ï¿½Studies
Fon hunter-gatherer folk tales suggest that these narratives include really important information
|  about the environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there ï¿½ stuff thatï¿½s relevant
|  to survival,ï¿½ he says  Yet in his analysis such elements were just as flexible as seemingly trivial
ï¿½[  details, What, then, is important enough to be reproduced from generation to generation?
|  The answer, it would appear, is fear ï¿½ blood-thirsty and gruesome aspects of the story, such as the
| eating of the grandmother by the wolf, turned out to be the best preserved of all  Why are these
| details retained by generations of storytellers, when other features are not? Tehrani has an idea:
|  ï¿½In an oral context, a story wonï¿½t survive because of one great teller  It also needs to be interesting
when itï¿½s told by someone whoï¿½s not necessarily a great storyteller ï¿½ Maybe being swallowed
whole by a wolf, then cut out of its stomach alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain
| popular, no matter how badly itï¿½s told 
~ Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is unconvinced by Tehraniï¿½s views on
fairy tales  ï¿½Even if they're gruesome, they wonï¿½t stick unless they matter,ï¿½ he says  He believes
the perennial theme of women as victims in stories like Little Red Riding Hood explains why they
continue to feel relevant  But Tehrani points out that although this is often the case in Western
- versions, it is not always true elsewhere  In Chinese and Japanese versions, often known as The
Tiger Grandmother, the villain is a woman, and in both Iran and Nigeria, the victim is a boy 
| Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University in Denmark isnï¿½t surprised by Tehraniï¿½s findings  ï¿½Habits
| and morals change, but the things that scare us, and the fact that we seek out entertainment thatï¿½s
designed to scare us ~- those are constant,ï¿½ he says  Clasen believes that scary stories teach us what
| it feels like to be afraid without having to experience real danger, and so build up resistance to
negative emotions

Passage  below  :
The return of the huarango
The arid valleys of southern Peru are welcoming :
the return of a native plant
The south coast of Peru is a narrow, ,-kilometre-long strip of desert squeezed between the i
Andes and the Pacific Ocean  It is also one of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth  It hardly ever
rains there, and the only year-round source of water is located tens of metres below the surface 
This is why the huarango tree is so suited to life there: it has the longest roots of any tree in the
world  They stretch down - metres and, as well as sucking up water for the tree, they bring it |
into the higher subsoil, creating a water source for other plant life  i
Dr David Beresford-Jones, archaeobotanist at Cambridge University, has been studying the role :
of the huarango tree in landscape change in the Lower Ica Vailey in southern Peru  He believes i
the huarango was key to the ancient peopleï¿½s diet and, because it could reach deep water sources, :
it allowed local people to withstand years of drought when their other crops failed  But over the E
centuries huarango trees were gradually replaced with crops  Cutting down native woodland leads
to erosion, as there is nothing to keep the soil in place  So when the huarangos go, the land turns i
into a desert  Nothing grows at all in the Lower Ica Valley now, :
For centuries the huarango tree was vital to the people of the neighbouring Middle Ica Valley :
too  They grew vegetables under it and ate products made from its seed pods  Its leaves and bark
were used for herbal remedies, while its branches were used for charcoal for cooking and heating, =
and its trunk was used to build houses  But now it is disappearing rapidly  The majority of the :
huarango forests in the valley have already been cleared for fuel and agriculture ~ initially, these
were smallholdings, but now theyï¿½re huge farms producing crops for the international market  :
ï¿½Of the forests that were here , years ago,  per cent have already gone,ï¿½ says botanist Oliver
Whaley from Kew Gardens in London, who, together with ethnobotanist Dr William Milliken, :
is running a pioneering project to protect and restore the rapidly disappearing habitat  In order
to succeed, Whaley needs to get the local people on board, and that has meant overcoming local
prejudices  ï¿½Increasingly aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your home
or street, it shows you are poor, and still need to grow your own food,ï¿½ he says  In order to stop
the Middle Ica Valley going the same way as the Lower Ica Valley, Whaley is encouraging locals
to love the huarangos again  ï¿½Itï¿½s a process of cultural resuscitation,ï¿½ he says  He has already set
up a huarango festival to reinstate a sense of pride in their eco-heritage, and has helped local
schoolchildren plant thousands of trees 
 :
" "Lo Reading
D
L ï¿½Jn order to get people interested in habitat restoration, you need to plant a tree that is useful to
|   ï¿½them,ï¿½ says Whaley  So, he has been working with local families to attempt to create a sustainable
{income from the huarangos by turning their products into foodstuffs  ï¿½Boil up the beans and you
LL get this thick brown syrup like molasses  You can also use it in drinks, soups or stews ï¿½ The pods
 --  can be ground into flour to make cakes, and the seeds roasted into a sweet, chocolatey ï¿½coffeeï¿½ 
/ b  ï¿½Itï¿½s packed full of vitamins and minerals,ï¿½ Whaley says 
|ï¿½ And some farmers are already planting huarangos  Alberto Benevides, owner of Ica Valleyï¿½s only

  produces syrup and flour, and selis these products at an organic farmersï¿½ market in Lima  His
|    farm is relatively small and doesnï¿½t yet provide him with enough to live on, but he hopes this

 But even if Whaley can convince the local people to fall in love with the huarango again, there is

| > strip  In the hope of counteracting this, heï¿½s persuading farmers to let him plant forest corridors
| on their land  He believes the extra woodland will also benefit the farms by reducing their water
d | usage through a lowering of evaporation and providing a refuge for bio-control insects 
i ï¿½If we can record biodiversity and see how it all works, then we're in a good position to move
on from there  Desert habitats can reduce down to very little,ï¿½ Whaley explains  ï¿½Itï¿½s not like a
FE rainforest that needs to have this huge expanse  Life has always been confined to corridors and
islands here  If you just have a few trees left, the population can grow up quickly because itï¿½s
used to exploiting water when it arrives ï¿½ He sees his project as a model that has the potential to
E be rolled out across other arid areas around the world  ï¿½If we can do it here, in the most fragile
system on Earth, then thatï¿½s a real message of hope for lots of places, including Africa, where

Passage  below 

Silbo Gomero ï¿½ the whistle ï¿½languageï¿½ of
the Canary Islands

La Gomera is one of the Canary Islands situated in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast
of Africa  This small volcanic island is mountainous, with steep rocky slopes and deep, wooded
ravines, rising to , metres at its highest peak  It is also home to the best known of the worldï¿½s
whistle ï¿½languagesï¿½, a means of transmitting information over long distances which is perfectly
adapted to the extreme terrain of the island  I
This ï¿½languageï¿½, known as ï¿½Silboï¿½ or ï¿½Silbo Gomeroï¿½ ï¿½ from the Spanish word for ï¿½whistleï¿½ ~
is now shedding light on the language-processing abilities of the human brain, according to
scientists  Researchers say that Silbo activates parts of the brain normally associated with spoken f
language, suggesting that the brain is remarkably fiexible in its ability to interpret sounds as
language 
ï¿½Science has developed the idea of brain areas that are dedicated to language, and we are starting
to understand the scope of signals that can be recognised as language, says David Corina,
co-author of a recent study and associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington
in Seattle  I
Silbo is a substitute for Spanish, with individual words recoded into whistles which have high- :
and low-frequency tones  A whistler ï¿½ or silbador ï¿½ puts a finger in his or her mouth to increase [
the whistleï¿½s pitch, while the other hand can be cupped to adjust the direction of the sound  ï¿½There |
is much more ambiguity in the whistled signal than in the spoken signal,ï¿½ explains lead researcher i
Manuel Carreiras, psychology professor at the University of La Laguna on the Canary island of |
Tenerife  Because whistled ï¿½wordsï¿½ can be hard to distinguish, silbadores rely on repetition, as i
well as awareness of context, to make themselves understood  |
The silbadores of Gomera are traditionally shepherds and other isolated mountain folk, and :
their novel means of staying in touch allows them to communicate over distances of up to i
 kilometres  Carreiras explains that silbadores are able to pass a surprising amount of :
information via their whistles  ï¿½In daily life they use whistles to communicate short commands, :
but any Spanish sentence could be whistled,ï¿½ Silbo has proved particularly useful when fires have
occurred on the island and rapid communication across large areas has been vital  i
 i
" " Reading

| The study team used neuroimaging equipment to contrast the brain activity of silbadores while

|| listening to whistled and spoken Spanish  Results showed the left temporal lobe of the brain,

 which is usually associated with spoken language, was engaged during the processing of Silbo 

 a The researchers found that other key regions in the brainï¿½s frontal lobe also responded to the

 be whistles, including those activated in response to sign language among deaf people  When the

a    experiments were repeated with non-whistlers, however, activation was observed in all areas of

 the brain 

hb ï¿½Our results provide more evidence about the flexibility of human capacity for language in a

|  variety of forms,ï¿½ Corina says  ï¿½These data suggest that left-hemisphere language regions are

|  uniquely adapted for communicative purposes, independent of the modality of signal  The non-

- Silbo speakers were not recognising Silbo as a language  They had nothing to grab onto, so

: | multiple areas of their brains were activated,ï¿½

A Carreiras says the origins of Silbo Gomero remain obscure, but that indigenous Canary Islanders,

[> who were of North African origin, already had a whistled language when Spain conquered the

 volcanic islands in the th century  Whistled languages survive today in Papua New Guinea,

Ab Mexico, Vietnam, Guyana, China, Nepal, Senegal, and a few mountainous pockets in southern

ap Europe  There are thought to be as many as  whistled languages still in use, though only 

ab have been described and studied scientifically  This form of communication is an adaptation
found among cultures where people are often isolated from each other, according to Julien

}  Meyer, a researcher at the Institute of Human Sciences in Lyon, France  ï¿½They are mostly used in

mountains or dense forests, he says  ï¿½Whistled languages are quite clearly defined and represent

: an original adaptation of the spoken language for the needs of isolated human groups ï¿½
But with modern communication technology now widely available, researchers say whistled
languages like Silbo are threatened with extinction  With dwindling numbers of Gomera islanders
still fluent in the language, Canariesï¿½ authorities are taking steps to try to ensure its survival 
Since , Silbo Gomero has been taught in all of the islandï¿½s elementary schools  In addition,
locals are seeking assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO)  ï¿½The local authorities are trying to get an award from the organisation
to declare [Silbo Gomero] as something that should be preserved for humanity, Carreiras adds

Passage  below 
Environmental practices of big businesses
The environmental practices of big businesses are shaped by a fundamental fact that for many of
us offends our sense of justice  Depending on the circumstances, a business may maximize the
amount of money it makes, at least in the short term, by damaging the environment and hurting
people  That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas, and for
international logging companies with short-term leases on tropical rainforest land in places with
corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners  When government regulation is effective, and |
when the public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean big businesses may out-compete
dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if government regulation is ineffective and if the :
public doesnï¿½t care 
It is easy for the rest of us to blame a business for helping itself by hurting other people 
But blaming alone is unlikely to produce change  It ignores the fact that businesses are not
charities but profit-making companies, and that publicly owned companies with shareholders
are under obligation to those shareholders to maximize profits, provided that they do so by
legal means  US laws make a companyï¿½s directors legally liable for something termed ï¿½breach
of fiduciary responsibilityï¿½ if they knowingly manage a company in a way that reduces profits 
The car manufacturer Henry Ford was in fact successfully sued by shareholders in  for
raising the minimum wage of his workers to $ per day: the courts declared that, while Fordï¿½s
humanitarian sentiments about his employees were nice, his business existed to make profits for
its stockholders  |
Our blaming of businesses also ignores the ultimate responsibility of the public for creating the
conditions that let a business profit through destructive environmental policies  In the long run, it
is the public, either directly or through its politicians, that has the power to make such destructive
policies unprofitable and illegal, and to make sustainable environmental policies profitable  ;
The public can do that by suing businesses for harming them, as happened after the Exxon Valdez
disaster, in which over , m? of oil were spilled off the coast of Alaska  The public may also |
make their opinion felt by preferring to buy sustainably harvested products; by making employees :
of companies with poor track records feel ashamed of their company and complain to their own :
management, by preferring their governments to award valuable contracts to businesses with a
good environmental track record; and by pressing their governments to pass and enforce laws and
regulations requiring good environmental practices  :

In turn, big businesses can exert powerful pressure on any suppliers that might ignore public
| or government pressure, For instance, after the US public became concerned about the spread
| ofa disease known as BSE, which was transmitted to humans through infected meat, the US
| government's Food and Drug Administration introduced rules demanding that the meat industry
= ï¿½abandon practices associated with the risk of the disease spreading  But for five years the meat
Co packers tefused to follow these, claiming that they would be too expensive to obey  However,
LL when a major fast-food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its
 hamburgers plummeted, the meat industry complied within weeks  The publicï¿½s task is therefore
b to identify which links in the supply chain are sensitive to public pressure: for instance, fast-food
| ï¿½ chains or jewelry stores, but not meat packers or gold miners 
be -ï¿½ Some readers may be disappointed or outraged that I place the ultimate responsibility for business
| ï¿½ practices harming the public on the public itself   also believe that the public must accept the
|  necessity for higher prices for products to cover the added costs, if any, of sound environmental
|  practices  My views may seem to ignore the belief that businesses should act in accordance with
| moral principles even if this leads to a reduction in their profits  But I think we have to recognize
| that, throughout human history, in ail politically complex human societies, government regulation
| > has arisen precisely because it was found that not only did moral principles need to be made
|  explicit, they also needed to be enforced 
L To me, the conclusion that the public has the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the
|  biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful, rather than disappointing  My conclusion is not a
b moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy  In the
E past, businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to
E reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses
|  practicing behaviors that the public didnï¿½t want  I predict that in the future, just as in the past,
|  changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businessesï¿½ environmental practices
