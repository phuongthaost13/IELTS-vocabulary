country of four million inhabitants  a long haul flight from all the major tourist generating markets of the world  Tourism currently makes up   of the country s gross domestic product  and is the country s largest export sector  Unlike other export sectors  which make products and then sell them overseas  tourism brings its customers to New Zealand  The product is the country itself   the people  the places and the experiences  In   Tourism New Zealand launched a campaign to communicate a ew brand position to the world  The campaign focused on New Zealand s scenic beauty  exhilarating outdoor activities and authentic Maori culture  and it made New Zealand one of the strongest ational brands in the world   Akey feature of the campaign was the website www ewzealand com  which provided potential visitors to New Zealand with a single gateway to everything the destination had to offer  The heart of the website was a database of tourism services operators  both those based in New Zealand and those based abroad which offered tourism services to the country  Any tourism related business could be listed by filling in a simple form  This meant that even the smallest bed and breakfast address or specialist activity provider could gain a web presence with access to an audience of long haul visitors  In addition  because participating businesses were able to update the details they gave ona  regular basis  the information provided remained accurate  And to maintain and improve standards  Tourism New Zealand organised a scheme whereby organisations appearing on the website underwent an independent evaluation against a set of agreed ational standards of quality  As part of this  the effect of each business on the environment was considered  To communicate the New Zealand experience  the site also carried features relating to famous people and places  One of the most popular was an interview with former New Zealand All Blacks rugby captain Tana Umaga  Another feature that attracted a  lot of attention was an interactive journey through a umber of the locations chosen for blockbuster films which had made use of New Zealand s stunning scenery as a backdrop  As the site developed  additional features were added to help independent travellers devise their own customised itineraries  To make it easier to plan motoring holidays  the site catalogued the most popular driving routes in the country  highlighting different routes according to the season and indicating distances and times     " "X Reading Leter  a Travel Planner feature was added  which allowed visitors to click and  bookmark  places or attractions they were interested in  and then view the results on a map  The Travel Planner offered suggested routes and public transport options between the chosen locations  There were also links to accommodation in the area  By registering with the website  users could save their Travel Plan and return to it later  or print it out    take on the visit  The website also had a  Your Words  section where anyone could submit a blog of their New Zealand travels for possible inclusion on the website  The Tourism New Zealand website won two Webby awards for online achievement nd innovation  More importantly perhaps  the growth of tourism to New Zealand was impressive  Overall tourism expenditure increased by an average of    per year between  and   From Britain  visits to New Zealand grew at an average annual rate of   between  and   compared to a rate of   overall for British wisits abroad  The website was set up to allow both individuals and travel organisations to create ineraries and travel packages to suit their own eeds and interests  On the website  wisitors can search for activities ot solely by geographical location  but also by the particular ature of the activity  This is important as research shows that activities are the key driver of visitor satisfaction  contributing   to visitor satisfaction  while transport and accommodation account for the remaining    The more activities that visitors undertake  the more satisfied they will be  It has also been found that visitors enjoy cultural activities most when they are interactive  such as visiting a marae  meeting ground  to learn about traditional Maori life  Many long haul travellers enjoy such jearning experiences  which provide them with stories to take home to their friends and family  In addition  it appears that visitors to New Zealand don t want to be  one of the crowd  and find activities that involve only a few people more special and meaningful  ft could be argued that New Zealand is ot a typical destination  New Zealand is a small country with a visitor economy composed mainly of small businesses  It is generally perceived as a safe English speaking country with a reliable transport infrastructure  Because of the long haul flight  most visitors stay for longer  average  days  and want to see as much of the country as possible on what is often seen as a once in a lifetime visit  However  the underlying lessons apply anywhere   the effectiveness of a strong brand  a strategy based on unique experiences

more interesting than we thought    We all know how it feels   it s impossible to keep your mind on anything  time stretches out  and all the things you could do seem equally unlikely to make you feel better  But defining boredom so that it can be studied in the lab has proved difficult  For a start  it can include a lot of other mental states  such as frustration  apathy  depression and indifference  There isn t even agreement over whether boredom is always a low energy  flat kind of emotion or whether feeling agitated and restless counts as boredom  too  In his book  Boredom  A Lively History  Peter Toohey at the University of Calgary  Canada  compares it to disgust   an emotion that motivates us to stay away from certain situations   If disgust protects humans from infection  boredom may protect them from  infectious  social situations   he suggests    By asking people about their experiences of boredom  Thomas Goetz and his team at the University of Konstanz in Germany have recently identified five distinct types  indifferent  calibrating  searching  reactant and apathetic  These can be plotted on two axes   one running left to right  which measures low to high arousal  and the other from top to bottom  which measures how positive or egative the feeling is  Intriguingly  Goetz has found that while people experience all kinds of boredom  they tend to specialise in one  Of the five types  the most damaging is  reactant  boredom with its explosive combination of high arousal and egative emotion  The most useful is what Goetz calls  indifferent  boredom  someone isn t engaged in   anything satisfying but still feels relaxed and calm  However  it remains to be seen   whether there are any character traits that predict the kind of boredom each of us   might be prone to    Psychologist Sandi Mann at the University of Central Lancashire  UK  goes further   All emotions are there for a reason  including boredom   she says  Mann has found that being bored makes us more creative   We re all afraid of being bored but in actual fact it can lead to all kinds of amazing things   she says  In experiments published last year  Mann found that people who had been made to feel bored by copying umbers out of the phone book for  minutes came up with more creative ideas about how to use a polystyrene cup than a control group  Mann concluded that a passive  boring activity is best for creativity because it allows the mind to wander  In fact  she goes so far as to suggest that we should seek out more boredom in our lives  D Psychologist John Eastwood at York University in Toronto  Canada  isn t convinced  If you are in a state of mind wandering you are ot bored   he says   In my view  by definition boredom is an undesirable state   That doesn t ecessarily mean that it isn t adaptive  he adds   Pain is adaptive   if we didn t have physical pain  bad things would happen to us  Does that mean that we should actively cause pain  No  But even if boredom has evolved to help us survive  it can still be toxic   " "X Test  if allowed to fester   For Eastwood  the central feature of boredom is a failure to put our  attention system  into gear  This causes an inability to focus on anything  which makes time seem to go painfully slowly  What s more  your efforts to improve the situation can end up making you feel worse   People try to connect with the world and if they are ot successful there s that frustration and irritability   he says  Perhaps most worryingly  says Eastwood  repeatedly failing to engage attention can lead to a state where we don t know what to do any more  and o longer care   E Eastwood s team is ow trying to explore why the attention system fails  It s early days but they think that at least some of it comes down to personality  Boredom proneness has been linked with a variety of traits  People who are motivated by pleasure seem to suffer particularly badly  Other personality traits  such as curiosity  are associated with a high boredom threshold  More evidence that boredom has detrimental effects comes from studies of people who are more or less prone to boredom  It seems those who bore easily face poorer prospects in education  their career and even life in general  But of course  boredom itself cannot kill   it s the things we do to deal with it that may put us in danger  What can we do to alleviate it before it comes to that  Goetz s group has one suggestion  Working with teenagers  they found that those who  approach  a boring situation   in other words  see that it s boring and get stuck in anyway   report less boredom than those who try to avoid it by using snacks  TV or social media for distraction   F Psychologist Francoise Wemelsfelder speculates that our over connected lifestyles might even be a ew source of boredom   In modern human society there is a lot of overstimulation but still a lot of problems finding meaning   she says  So instead of seeking yet more mental stimulation  perhaps we should leave our phones alone  and use boredom to motivate us to engage with the world in a more meaningful way   " "X Reading  Questions    Leok at the following

based on Reading Passage  below  Artificial artists Can computers really create works of art  The Painting Fool is one of a growing umber of computer programs which  so their makers claim  possess creative talents  Classical music by an artificial composer has  had audiences enraptured  and even tricked them into believing a human was behind the score  Artworks painted by a robot have sold for thousands of dollars and been hung in prestigious galleries  And software has been built which creates art that could ot have been imagined by the programmer  Human beings are the only species to perform sophisticated creative acts regularly  If we can break this process down into computer code  where does that leave human creativity   This is a question at the very core of humanity   says Geraint Wiggins  a computational creativity researcher at Goldsmiths  University of London   It scares a lot of people  They are worried that it is taking something special away from what it means to be human   To some extent  we are alll familiar with computerised art  The question is  where does the work of the artist stop and the creativity of the computer begin  Consider one of the oldest machine artists  Aaron  a robot that has had paintings exhibited in London s Tate Modem and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art  Aaron can pick up a paintbrush and paint on canvas on its own  Impressive perhaps  but itis still little more than a tool to realise the programmer s own creative ideas  Simon Colton  the designer of the Painting Fool  is keen to make sure his creation doesn t attract the same criticism  Unlike earlier  artists  such as Aaron  the Painting Fool only eeds minimal direction and can come up with its own concepts by going online for material  The software runs its own web searches and trawis through social media sites  It is ow beginning to display a kind of imagination too  creating pictures from scratch  One of its original works is a series of fuzzy landscapes  depicting trees and sky  While some might say they have a mechanical look  Colton argues that such reactions arise from people s double standards towards software produced and human produced art  After all  he says  consider that the Painting Fool painted the landscapes without referring to a photo   Ifa child painted a ew scene from its head  you d say it has a certain level of imagination   he points out   The same should be true of a machine   Software bugs can also lead to unexpected results  Some of the Painting Fool s Paintings of a chair came out in black and white  thanks to a technical glitch  This gives the work an eerie  ghostlike quality  Human artists like the renowned Ellsworth Kelly are lauded for limiting their colour palette   so why should computers be any different    " "X Reading  Researchers like Colton don t believe it is right to measure machine creativity directly to that of humans who  have had millennia to develop our skills   Others  though  are fascinated by the prospect thal w computer might create something as original and subtle as our best artists  So far  only one has come close  Composer David Cope invented a program called Experiments in Musical intelligence  or EMI  Not only did EMI create compositions in Cope s style  but also that of the most revered classical composers  including Bach  Chopin and Mozart  Audiences were moved to tears  and EMI even fooled classical music experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach  Not everyone was impressed however  Some  such as Wiggins  have blasted Cope s work as pseudoscience  and condemned him for his deliberately vague explanation of how the software worked  Meanwhile  Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University said EMI created replicas which still rely completely on the original artist s creative impulses  When audiences found out the truth they were often outraged with Cope  and one music lover even tried to punch him  Amid such controversy  Cope destroyed EMI s vital databases But why did so many people love the music  yet recoil when they discovered how it was composed  A study by computer scientist David Moffat of Glasgow Caledonian University provides a clue  He asked both expert musicians and on experts to assess six compositions  The participants weren t told beforehand whether the tunes were composed by humans or computers  but were asked to guess  and then rate how much they liked each one  People who thought the composer was a computer tended to dislike the piece more than those who believed it was human  This was true even among the experts  who might have been expected to be more objective in their analyses  Where does this prejudice come from  Paul Bloom of Yale University has a suggestion he reckons part of the pleasure we get from art stems from the creative process behind the work  This can give it an  irresistible essence   says Bloom  Meanwhile  experiments by Justin Kruger of New York University have shown that people s enjoyment of an artwork increases if they think more time and effort was eeded to create it  Similarly  Colton thinks that when people experience art  they wonder what the artist might have been thinking or what the artist is trying to tell them  It seems obvious  therefore  that with computers producing art  this speculation is cut short   there s othing to explore  But as technology becomes increasingly complex  finding those greater depths in computer art could become possible  This is precisely why Colton asks the Painting Fool to tap into online social etworks for its inspiration  hopefully this way it will choose themes that will already be meaningful to us    " "X Test  Questions   Choose the correct letter  A  B  C or D  Write the correct letter in boxes

spice produced from the inner bark of trees of the genus Cinnamomum  which is ative to the Indian sub continent  It was known in biblical times  and is mentioned in several books of the Bible  both as an ingredient that was mixed with oils for anointing people s bodies  and also as a token indicating friendship among lovers and friends  In ancient Rome  mourners attending funerals burnt cinnamon to create a pleasant scent  Most often  however  the spice found its primary use as an additive to food and drink  In the Middle Ages  Europeans who could afford the spice used it to flavour food  particularly meat  and to impress those around them with their ability to purchase an expensive condiment from the  exotic  East  At a banquet  a host would offer guests a plate with various spices piled upon it as a sign of the wealth at his or her disposal  Cinnamon was also reported to have health benefits  and was thought to cure various ailments  such as indigestion  Toward the end of the Middle Ages  the European middle classes began to desire  the lifestyle of the elite  including their consumption of spices  This led to a growth in demand for cinnamon and other spices  At that time  cinnamon was transported by Arab merchants  who closely guarded the secret of the source of the spice from potential rivals  They took it from India  where it was grown  on camels via an overland route  to the Mediterranean  Their journey ended when they reached Alexandria  European traders sailed there to purchase their supply of cinnamon  then brought it back to Venice  The spice then travelled from that great trading city to markets all around Europe  Because the overland trade route allowed for only small quantities of the spice to reach Europe  and because Venice had a virtual monopoly of the trade  the Venetians could set the price of cinnamon exorbitantly high  These prices  coupled with the increasing demand  spurred the search for ew routes to Asia by Europeans eager to take part in the spice trade   Seeking the high profits promised by the cinnamon market  Portuguese traders arrived on the island of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean toward the end of the th century  Before Europeans arrived on the island  the state had organized the cultivation of cinnamon  People belonging to the ethnic group called the Salagama would peel the bark off young shoots of the cinnamon plant in the rainy season  when the wet bark was  more pliable  During the peeling process  they curled the bark into the  stick  shape  still associated with the spice today  The Salagama then gave the finished product to the king as a form of tribute  When the Portuguese arrived  they eeded to increase   " "X Reading production significantly  and so enslaved many other members of the Ceylonese ative population  forcing them to work in cinnamon harvesting  In   the Portuguese built a fort on Ceylon  which enabled them to protect the island  so helping them to develop a monopoly in the cinnamon trade and generate very high profits  In the late th century  for example  they enjoyed a tenfold profit when shipping cinnamon over a journey of eight days from Ceylon to India   When the Dutch arrived off the coast of southern Asia at the very beginning of the th century  they set their sights on displacing the Portuguese as kings of cinnamon  The Dutch allied themselves with Kandy  an inland kingdom on Ceylon  In return for payments of elephants and cinnamon  they protected the ative king from the Portuguese  By   the Dutch broke the  year Portuguese monopoly when they overran and occupied their factories  By   they had permanently expelled the Portuguese from the island  thereby gaining control of the lucrative cinnamon trade  In order to protect their hold on the market  the Dutch  like the Portuguese before them  treated the ative inhabitants harshly  Because of the eed to boost production and satisfy Europe s ever increasing appetite for cinnamon  the Dutch began to alter the harvesting practices of the Ceylonese  Over time  the supply of cinnamon trees on the island became early exhausted  due to systematic stripping of the bark  Eventually  the Dutch began cultivating their own cinnamon trees to supplement the diminishing umber of wild trees available for use  Then  in   the English arrived on Ceylon  thereby displacing the Dutch from their control of the cinnamon monopoly  By the middle of the th century  production of cinnamon reached   tons a year  after a lower grade quality of the spice became acceptable to European tastes  By that time  cinnamon was being grown in other parts of the Indian Ocean region and in the West Indies  Brazil  and Guyana  Not only was a Monopoly of cinnamon becoming impossible  but the spice trade overall was diminishing in  conomic potential  and was eventually superseded by the rise of trade in coffee  tea  chocolate  and sugar     " "X I Test  Questions   Complete the otes below  Choose ONE WORD ONLY

hormone   A Oxytocin is a chemical  a hormone produced in the pituitary gland in the brain  It was through various studies focusing on animals that scientists first became aware of the influence of oxytocin  They discovered that it helps reinforce the bonds between prairie voles  which mate for life  and triggers the motherly behaviour that sheep show towards their ewborn lambs  It is also released by women in childbirth  strengthening the attachment between mother and baby  Few chemicals have as positive a reputation as oxytocin  which is sometimes referred to as the  love hormone   One sniff of it can  it is claimed  make a person more trusting  empathetic  generous and cooperative  It is time  however  to revise this wholly optimistic view  A ew wave of studies has shown that its effects vary greatly depending on the person and the circumstances  and it can impact on our social interactions for worse as well as for better   B   Oxytocin s role in human behaviour first emerged in   In a groundbreaking experiment  Markus Heinrichs and his colleagues at the University of Freiburg  Germany  asked volunteers to do an activity in which they could invest money with an anonymous person who was ot guaranteed to be honest  The team found that participants who had sniffed oxytocin via a asal spray beforehand invested more money than those who received a placebo instead  The study was the start of research into the effects of oxytocin on human interactions   For eight years  it was quite a lonesome field   Heinrichs recalls   Now  everyone is interested   These follow up studies have shown that after a sniff of the hormone  people become more charitable  better at reading emotions on others  faces and at communicating constructively in arguments  Together  the results fuelled the view that oxytocin universally enhanced the positive aspects of our social ature   C Then  after a few years  contrasting findings began to emerge  Simone Shamay  Tsoory at the University of Haifa  Israel  found that when volunteers played a competitive game  those who inhaled the hormone showed more pleasure when they beat other players  and felt more envy when others won  What s more  administering oxytocin also has sharply contrasting outcomes depending on a person s disposition  Jennifer Bartz from Mount Sinai School of Medicine  New   York  found that it improves people s ability to read emotions  but only if they are not very socially adept to begin with  Her research also shows that oxytocin in fact reduces cooperation in subjects who are particularly anxious or sensitive to rejection     " "X Reading Another discovery is that oxytocin s effects vary depending on who we are interacting with  Studies conducted by Carolyn DeClerck of the University of Antwerp  Belgium  revealed that People who had received a dose of oxytocin actually became less cooperative when dealing with complete strangers  Meanwhile  Carsten De Dreu at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands discovered that volunteers given oxytocin showed favouritism  Dutch men became quicker to associate positive words with Dutch ames than with foreign ones  for example  According to De Dreu  oxytocin drives people to care for those in their social circles and defend them from outside dangers  So  it appears that oxytocin strengthens biases  rather than promoting general goodwill  as was previously thought  There were signs of these subtleties from the start  Bartz has recently shown that in almost half of the existing research results  oxytocin influenced only certain individuals or in certain circumstances  Where once researchers took o otice of such findings  ow a more uanced understanding of oxytocin s effects is propelling investigations down ew lines  To Bartz  the key to understanding what the hormone does lies in pinpointing its core function rather than in cataloguing its seemingly endless effects  There are several hypotheses which are ot mutually exclusive  Oxytocin could help to reduce anxiety and fear  Or it could simply motivate people to seek out social connections  She believes that oxytocin acts as a chemical spotlight that shines on social clues   a shift in posture  a flicker of the eyes  a dip in the voice   making people more attuned to their social environment  This would explain why it makes us more likely to look others in the eye and improves our ability to identify emotions  But it could also make things worse for people who are overly sensitive or Prone to interpreting social cues in the worst light   F Perhaps we should ot be surprised that the oxytocin story has become more perplexing  The hormone is found in everything from octopuses to sheep  and its evolutionary roots stretch back half a billion years   It s a very simple and ancient molecule that has been co opted for many different functions   says Sue Carter at the University of Illinois  Chicago  USA   It affects Primitive parts of the brain like the amygdala  so it s going to have many effects on just about everything   Bartz agrees   Oxytocin probably does some very basic things  but once you add our higher order thinking and social situations  these basic Processes could manifest in different ways depending on individual differences and context    " "X Test  Questions   Reading Passage  has six paragraphs  A F  Which

School give advice to managers  Most managers can identify the major trends of the day  But in the course of conducting research in a umber of industries and working directly with companies  we have discovered that managers often fail to recognize the less obvious but profound ways these trends are influencing consumers  aspirations  attitudes  and behaviors  This is especially true of trends that managers view as peripheral to their core markets   Many ignore trends in their innovation strategies or adopt a wait and see approach and let competitors take the lead  At a minimum  such responses mean missed profit opportunities  At the extreme  they can jeopardize a company by ceding to rivals the opportunity to transform the industry  The purpose of this article is twofold  to spur managers to think more expansively about how trends could engender ew value propositions in their core markets  and to provide some high level advice on how to make market research and product development personnel more adept at analyzing and exploiting trends   One strategy  known as  infuse and augment   is to design a product or service that retains most of the attributes and functions of existing products in the category but adds others that address the eeds and desires unleashed by a major trend  A case in point is the Poppy range of handbags  which the firm Coach created in response to the economic downtum of   The Coach brand had been a symbol of opulence and luxury for early  years  and the most obvious reaction  to the downturn would have been to lower prices  However  that would have risked cheapening the brand s image  Instead  they initiated a consumer research project which revealed that customers were eager to lift themselves and the country out of tough times  Using these insights  Coach launched the lower priced Poppy handbags  which were in vibrant colors  and looked more youthfill and playful than conventional Coach products  Creating the sub brand allowed Coach to avert an across the board price cut  In contrast to the many companies that responded to the recession by cutting prices  Coach saw the ew consumer mindset as an opportunity for innovation and renewal   A further example of this strategy was supermarket Tesco s response to consumers  growing concerns about the environment  With that in mind  Tesco  one of the world s top five retailers  introduced its Greener Living program  which demonstrates the company s commitment to protecting the environment by involving consumers in ways that produce tangible results  For example  Tesco customers can accumulate points for such activities as reusing bags  recycling cans and printer cartridges  and buying home insulation materials  Like points earned on regular purchases  these green points can be redeemed for cash  Tesco has ot abandoned its traditional retail offerings but augmented its business with these innovations  thereby infusing its value proposition with a green streak    " "X Reading A more radical strategy is  combine and transcend   This entails combining aspects of the product s existing value proposition with attributes addressing changes arising from a trend  to create a ovel experience   one that may land the company in an entirely ew market space  At first glance  spending resources to incorporate elements of a seemingly irrelevant trend into one s core offerings sounds like it s hardly worthwhile  But consider Nike s move to integrate the digital revolution into its reputation for high performance athletic footwear  In   they teamed up with technology company Apple to launch Nike   a digital sports kit comprising a sensor that attaches to the running shoe and a wireless receiver that connects to the user s iPod  By combining Nike s original value proposition for amateur athletes with one for digital consumers  the Nike  sports kit and web interface moved the company from a focus on athletic apparel to a new plane of engagement with its customers  A third approach  known as  counteract and reaffirm   involves developing products or services that stress the values traditionally associated with the category in ways that allow consumers to  oppose   or at least temporarily escape from   the aspects of trends they view as undesirable  A product that accomplished this is the ME  a video game created by Canada s  Toys  By reaffirming the toy category s association with physical play  the ME counteracted some of the widely perceived egative impacts of digital gaming devices  Like other handheld games  the device featured a host of exciting interactive games  a full color LCD screen  and advanced D graphics  What set it apart was that it incorporated the traditional physical component of children s play  it contained a pedometer  which tracked and awarded points for physical activity  walking  running  biking  skateboarding  climbing stairs   The child could use the points to enhance various virtual skills eeded for the video game   The ME  introduced in mid    catered to kids  huge desire to play video games while countering the egatives  such as associations with lack of exercise and obesity  Once you have gained perspective on how trend related changes in consumer opinions and behaviors impact on your category  you can determine which of our three innovation strategies to pursue  When your category s basic value proposition continues to be meaningful for consumers influenced by the trend  the infuse and augment strategy will allow you to reinvigorate the category  If analysis reveals an increasing disparity between your category and consumers  ew focus  your innovations eed to transcend the category to integrate the wo worlds  Finally  if aspects of the category clash with undesired outcomes of a trend  such as associations with unhealthy lifestyles  there is an opportunity to counteract those changes by reaffirming the core values of your category  Trends   technological  economic  environmental  social  or political   that affect how people perceive the world around them and shape what they expect from products and services present firms with unique opportunities for growth   " "X Test  Questions   Choose the correct letter  A  B  C or D  Write the correct letter in boxes   on your answer sheet   In the first paragraph  the writer says that most

world  on the other hand  coconuts have always been exotic and unusual  sometimes rare  The Italian merchant traveller Marco Polo apparently saw coconuts  in South Asia in the late th century  and among the mid th century travel writings  of Sir John Mandeville there is mention of  great Notes of Ynde   great Nuts of India   Today  images of palm fringed tropical beaches are clich�s in the west to sell holidays  chocolate bars  fizzy drinks and even romance   Typically  we envisage coconuts as brown cannonballs that  when opened  provide sweet white flesh  But we see only part of the fruit and one of the plant from which they come  The coconut palm has a smooth  slender  grey trunk  up to  metres tall  This  is an important source of timber for building houses  and is increasingly being used as  a replacement for endangered hardwoods in the furniture construction industry  The trunk is surmounted by a rosette of leaves  each of which may be up to six metres long  The leaves have hard veins in their centres which  in many parts of the world  are used as brushes after the green part of the leaf has been stripped away  Immature coconut flowers are tightly clustered together among the leaves at the top of the trunk  The flower stems may be tapped for their sap to produce a drink  and the sap can also be reduced by boiling to produce a type of sugar used for cooking  Coconut palms produce as many as seventy fruits per year  weighing more than a kilogram each  The wall of the fruit has three layers  a waterproof outer layer  a fibrous middle layer and a hard  inner layer  The thick fibrous middle layer produces coconut fibre   coir   which has umerous uses and is particularly important in manufacturing ropes  The woody innermost layer  the shell  with its three prominent  eyes   surrounds the seed  An important product obtained from the shell is charcoal  which is widely used in various industries as well as in the home as a cooking fuel  When broken in half  the shells are also used as bowls in many parts of Asia   Inside the shell are the utrients  endosperm  eeded by the developing seed  Initially  the endosperm is a sweetish liquid  coconut water  which is enjoyed as a drink  but also provides the hormones which encourage other plants to grow more rapidly and produce higher yields  As the fruit matures  the coconut water gradually solidifies to form the brilliant white  fat rich  edible flesh or meat  Dried coconut flesh   copra   is made into coconut oil and coconut milk  which are widely used in cooking in different parts of the world  as well as in cosmetics  A derivative of coconut fat  glycerine  acquired strategic   " "X Reading importance in a quite different sphere  as Alfred Nobel introduced the world to his nitroglycerine based invention  dynamite   Their biology would appear to make coconuts the great maritime voyagers and coastal colonizers of the plant world  The large  energy rich fruits are able to float in water and tolerate salt  but cannot remain viable indefinitely  studies suggest after about  days at sea they are o longer able to germinate  Literally cast onto desert island shores  with little more than sand to grow in and exposed to the full glare of the tropical sun  coconut seeds are able to germinate and root  The air pocket in the seed  created as the endosperm solidifies  protects the embryo  In addition  the fibrous fruit wall that helped it to float during the voyage stores moisture that can be taken up by the roots of the coconut seedling as it starts to grow  There have been centuries of academic debate over the origins of the coconut  There were o coconut palms in West Africa  the Caribbean or the east coast of the Americas before the voyages of the European explorers Vasco da Gama and Columbus in the late th and early th centuries  th century trade and human migration patterns reveal that Arab traders and European sailors are likely to have moved coconuts from South and Southeast Asia to Africa and then across the Atlantic to the east coast of America  But the origin of coconuts discovered along the west coast of America by th century sailors has been the subject of centuries of discussion  Two diametrically opposed origins have been proposed  that they came from Asia  or that they were ative to America  Both suggestions have problems  In Asia  there is a large degree of coconut diversity and evidence of millennia of human use   but there are o relatives growing in the wild  In America  there are close coconut relatives  but o evidence that coconuts are indigenous  These problems have led to the intriguing suggestion that coconuts originated on coral islands in the Pacific and were dispersed from there     " "X Test  Questions   Complete the table

infant brains a boost  A The typical way of talking to a baby   high pitched  exaggerated and repetitious   is a source of fascination for linguists who hope to understand how  baby talk  impacts  on learning  Most babies start developing their hearing while still in the womb  prompting some hopeful parents to play classical music to their pregnant bellies  Some research even suggests that infants are listening to adult speech as early as  weeks before being born  gathering the basic building blocks of their family s native tongue   B Early language exposure seems to have benefits to the brain   for instance  studies suggest that babies raised in bilingual homes are better at learning how to mentally prioritize information  So how does the sweet if sometimes absurd sound of infant  directed speech influence a baby s development  Here are some recent studies that explore the science behind baby talk   C Fathers don t use baby talk as often or in the same ways as mothers   and that s perfectly OK  according to a ew study  Mark VanDam of Washington State University at Spokane and colleagues equipped parents with recording devices and speech recognition software to study the way they interacted with their youngsters during a ormal day   We found that moms do exactly what you d expect and what s been described many times over   VanDam explains   But we found that dads aren t doing the same thing  Dads didn t raise their pitch or fundamental frequency when they talked to kids   Their role may be rooted in what is called the bridge hypothesis  which dates back to   It suggests that fathers use less familial language to provide their children with a bridge to the kind of speech they ll hear in public   The idea is that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and another kind of speech with dad  so the kid then has a wider repertoire of kinds of speech to practice   says VanDam   D Scientists from the University of Washington and the University of Connecticut collected thousands of  second conversations between parents and their babies  fitting  children with audio recording vests that captured language and sound during a typical eight hour day  The study found that the more baby talk parents used  the more their youngsters began to babble  And when researchers saw the same babies at age two  they found that frequent baby talk had dramatically boosted vocabulary  regardless of socioeconomic status   Those children who listened to a lot of baby talk were talking more than the babies that listened to more    " "X Reading adult talk or standard speech   says Nairan Ramirez Esparza of the University of Connecticut   We also found that it really matters whether you use baby talk ina one on one context   she adds   The more parents use baby talk one on one  the more babies babble  and the more they babble  the more words they produce later in life      Another study suggests that parents might want to pair their youngsters up so they can babble more with their own kind  Researchers from McGill University and Universit� du Qu�bec a Montr�al found that babies seem to like listening to each other rather than to adults   which may be why baby talk is such a universal tool among parents  They played repeating vowel sounds made by a special synthesizing device that mimicked sounds made by either an adult woman or another baby  This way  only the impact of the auditory cues was observed  The team then measured how long each type of sound held the infants  attention  They found that the  infant  sounds held babies  attention early  percent longer  The   baby oises also induced more reactions in the listening infants  like smiling or lip moving  which approximates sound making  The team theorizes that this attraction to other infant sounds could help launch the learning process that leads to  speech   It may be some property of the sound that is just drawing their attention   says study co author Linda Polka   Or maybe they are really interested in that particular type of sound because they are starting to focus on their own ability to make sounds  We are speculating here but it might catch their attention because they recognize it as a sound they could possibly make     Ina study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  a total of  babies from two slightly different age groups   seven months and eleven and a half months   were played a umber of syllables from both their ative language  English  and a on ative tongue  Spanish   The infants were placed in a brain  activation scanner that recorded activity in a brain region known to guide the motor movements that produce speech  The results suggest that listening to baby talk Prompts infant brains to start practicing their language skills   Finding activation in motor areas of the brain when infants are simply listening is significant  because   it means the baby brain is engaged in trying to talk back right from the start and suggests that seven month olds  brains are already trying to figure out how to make the right movements that will produce words   says co author Patricia Kuhl  Another interesting finding was that while the seven month olds responded to all speech sounds regardless of language  the brains of the older infants worked harder at the motor activations of on ative sounds compared to ative sounds  The study may have also uncovered a process by which babies recognize differences between their ative language and other tongues   " "X Test  Questions   Look at the

based on Reading  Passage  below   Whatever happened to the Harappan Civilisation   New research sheds light on the disappearance of an ancient society  A The Harappan Civilisation of ancient Pakistan and India flourished   years ago  but a thousand years later their cities were abandoned  The Harappan Civilisation was a sophisticated Bronze Age society who built  megacities  and traded internationally in luxury craft products  and yet seemed to have left almost   no depictions of themselves  But their lack of self imagery   at a time when the Egyptians were carving and painting representations of themselves all over their temples   is only part of the mystery   B  There is plenty of archaeological evidence to tell us about the rise of the Harappan Civilisation  but relatively little about its fall   explains archaeologist Dr Cameron Petrie of the University of Cambridge   As populations increased  cities were built that had great baths  craft workshops  palaces and halls laid out in distinct sectors  Houses were arranged in blocks  with wide main streets and arrow alleyways  and many had their own wells and drainage systems  It was very much a  thriving  civilisation   Then around  BC  a transformation began  Streets went uncleaned  buildings started to be abandoned  and ritual structures fell out of use  After their final demise  a millennium passed before really large scale cities appeared once more in South Asia   C Some have claimed that major glacier fed rivers changed their course  dramatically  affecting the water supply and agriculture  or that the cities could ot cope with an increasing population  they exhausted their resource base  the trading economy broke down or they succumbed to invasion and conflict  and yet others that climate change caused an environmental change that affected food and water provision   It is unlikely that there was a single cause for the decline of the civilisation  But the fact is  until ow  we have had little solid evidence from the area for most of the key elements   said Petrie   A lot of the archaeological debate has really only been well  argued speculation    D  Aresearch team led by Petrie  together with Dr Ravindanath Singh of Banaras Hindu University in India  found early in their investigations that many of the archaeological sites were ot where they were supposed to be  completely altering understanding of the way that this region was inhabited in the past  When they carried out a survey of how the larger area was settled in relation to sources of water  they found inaccuracies in the published geographic locations of ancient settlements ranging from several hundred metres to many kilometres  They realised    " "X Reading that any attempts to use the existing data were likely to be fundamentally flawed  Over the course of several seasons of fieldwork they carried out ew surveys  finding an astonishing  settlement sites that were previously unknown   E Now  research published by Dr Yama Dixit and Professor David Hodell  both from Cambridge s Department of Earth Sciences  has provided the first definitive    evidence for climate change affecting the plains of orth western India  where hundreds of Harappan sites are known to have been situated  The researchers gathered shells of Melanoides tuberculata snails from the sediments of an ancient lake and used geochemical analysis as a means of tracing the climate history of the region   As today  the major source of water into the lake is likely to have been the summer monsoon   says Dixit   But we have observed that there was an abrupt change about   years ago  when the amount of evaporation from the lake exceeded the rainfall   indicative of a drought   Hodell adds   We estimate that the weakening of the Indian summer monsoon climate lasted about  years before recovering to the previous conditions  which we still see today    F It has long been thought that other great Bronze Age civilisations also declined at a similar time  with a global scale climate event being seen as the cause  While it is possible that these local scale processes were linked  the real archaeological interest lies in understanding the impact of these larger scale events on different environments and different populations   Considering the vast area of the Harappan Civilisation with its variable weather systems   explains Singh   it is essential that we obtain more climate data from areas close to the two great cities at Mohenjodaro and Harappa and also from the Indian Punjab    G Petrie and Singh s team is ow examining archaeological records and trying to understand details of how people led their lives in the region five millennia ago  They are analysing grains cultivated at the time  and trying to work out whether they were grown under extreme conditions of water stress  and whether they were adjusting the combinations of crops they were growing for different weather systems  They are also looking at whether the types of pottery used  and other aspects of their material culture  were distinctive to specific regions or were more similar across larger areas  This gives us insight into the types of interactive networks that the population was involved in  and whether those changed   H Petrie believes that archaeologists are in a unique position to investigate how past societies responded to environmental and climatic change   By investigating responses to environmental pressures and threats  we can learn from the past to engage with the public  and the relevant governmental and administrative bodies  to be more proactive in issues such as the management and administration of water supply  the balance of urban and rural development  and the importance of preserving cultural heritage in the future      " "X Test   Questions    Reading Passage  has eight paragraphs  A H  Which paragraph contains the following information   Write the correct letter  A H  in boxes   on your

Sark  the fastest sailing ship of all time The ineteenth century was a period of great technological development in Britain  and for shipping the major changes were from wind to steam power  and from wood to iron and steel  The fastest commercial sailing vessels of all time were clippers  three masted ships built to transport goods around the world  although some also took passengers  From the s until   when the Suez Canal opened and steam propulsion was replacing sail  clippers dominated world trade  Although many were built  only one has survived more or less intact  Cutty Sark  now on display in Greenwich  southeast London  Cutty Sark s unusual ame comes from the poem Tam O Shanter by the Scottish poet Robert Burns  Tam  a farmer  is chased by a witch called Nannie  who is wearing a  cufty sark   an old Scottish ame for a short ightdress  The witch is depicted in Cutty Sark s figurehead   the carving of a woman typically at the front of old sailing ships  In legend  and in Burns s poem  witches cannot cross water  so this was a rather strange choice of ame for a ship  Cutty Sark was built in Dumbarton  Scotland  in   for a shipping company owned by John Willis  To carry out construction  Willis chose a ew shipbuilding firm  Scott   Linton  and ensured that the contract with them put him in a very strong position  In the end  the firm was forced out of business  and the ship was finished by a competitor  Willis s company was active in the tea trade between China and Britain  where speed could bring shipowners both profits and prestige  so Cuity Sark was designed to make the journey more quickly than any other ship  On her maiden voyage  in   she set sail from London  carrying large amounts of goods to China  She returned laden with tea  making the journey back to London in four months  However  Cutty Sark ever lived up to the high expectations of her  owner  as a result of bad winds and various misfortunes  On one occasion  in   the ship and a rival clipper  Thermopylae  left port in China on the same day  Crossing the Indian Ocean  Cutty Sark gained a lead of over  miles  but then her rudder was severely damaged in stormy seas  making her impossible to steer  The ship s crew had the daunting task of repairing the rudder at sea  and only succeeded at the second attempt  Cutty Sark reached London a week after Thermopylae    " "X Reading Steam ships posed a growing threat to clippers  as their speed and cargo capacity increased  In addition  the opening of the Suez Canal in   the same year that Cutty Sark was launched  had a serious impact  While steam ships could make use of the quick  direct route between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea  the canal was of o use to sailing ships  which eeded the much stronger winds of the oceans  and so had to sail a far greater distance  Steam ships reduced the journey time between Britain and China by approximately two months  By   tea traders weren t interested in Cutty Sark  and instead  she took on the much less prestigious work of carrying any cargo between any two ports in the world  In   violence aboard the ship led ultimately to the replacement of the captain with an incompetent drunkard who stole the crew s wages  He was suspended from service  and a ew captain appointed  This  marked a turnaround and the beginning of the most successful period in Cutty Sark s working life  transporting wool from Australia to Britain  One such journey took just under  weeks  beating every other ship sailing that year by around a month  The ship s ext captain  Richard Woodget  was an excellent avigator  who got the best out of both his ship and his crew  As a sailing ship  Cutty Sark depended on the strong trade winds of the southern hemisphere  and Woodget took her further south than any previous captain  bringing her dangerously close to icebergs off the southern tip of South America  His gamble paid off  though  and the ship was the fastest vessel in the wool trade for ten years  As competition from steam ships increased in the s  and Cutty Sark approached the end of her life expectancy  she became less profitable  She was sold to a Portuguese firm  which renamed her Ferreira  For the ext  years  she again carried miscellaneous cargoes around the world Badly damaged in a gale in   she was put into Falmouth harbour in southwest England  for repairs  Wilfred Dowman  a retired sea captain who owned a training vessel  recognised her and tried to buy her  but without success  She returned to Portugal and was sold to another Portuguese company  Dowman was determined  however  and offered a high price  this was accepted  and the ship returned to Falmouth the following year and had her original ame restored  Dowman used Cutty Sark as a training ship  and she continued in this role after his death  When she was o longer required  in   she was transferred to dry dock at Greenwich to go on public display  The ship suffered from fire

Reading  passage  below   SAVING THE SOIL More than a third of the Earth s top layer is at risk  Is there hope for our planet s most precious resource   A More than a third of the world s soil is endangered  according to a recent UN report  Ifwe don t slow the decline  all farmable soil could be gone in  years  Since soil grows   of our food  and sustains human life in other more surprising ways  that is a huge problem   B Peter Groffman  from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York  points out that soil scientists have been warning about the degradation of the world s soil for decades  At the same time  our understanding of its importance to humans has grown  A single gram of healthy soil might contain  million bacteria  as well as other microorganisms such as viruses and fungi  living amid decomposing plants and various minerals   That means soils do ot just grow our food  but are the source of early all our existing antibiotics  and could be our best hope in the fight against antibiotic  resistant bacteria  Soil is also an ally against climate change  as microorganisms within soil digest dead animals and plants  they lock in their carbon content  holding three times the amount of carbon as does the entire atmosphere  Soils also store water  preventing flood damage  in the UK  damage to buildings  roads and bridges from floods caused by soil degradation costs   million every year   C Ifthe soil loses its ability to perform these functions  the human race could be in  big trouble  The danger is ot that the soil will disappear completely  but that the microorganisms that give it its special properties will be lost  And once this has happened  it may take the soil thousands of years to recover   Agriculture is by far the biggest problem  In the wild  when plants grow they remove nutrients from the soil  but then when the plants die and decay these utrients are feturned directly to the soil  Humans tend ot to return unused parts of harvested crops directly to the soil to enrich it  meaning that the soil gradually becomes  less fertile  In the past we developed strategies to get around the problem  such  as regularly varying the types of crops grown  or leaving fields uncultivated for a season   D But these practices became inconvenient as populations grew and agriculture had to be run on more commercial lines  A solution came in the early th century with the Haber Bosch process for manufacturing ammonium itrate  Farmers have been Putting this synthetic fertiliser on their fields ever since     " "X Test  i clear this

that the best way to ensure his trees flourished was to take care of the soil  and has developed a cocktail of beneficial bacteria  fungi and humus  to do this  Researchers at the University of Valladolid in Spain recently used this cocktail on soils destroyed by years of fertiliser overuse When they applied Floris s mix to the desert like test plots  a good crop of plants emerged that were ot just healthy at the surface  but had roots strong enough to pierce dirt as hard as rock  The few plants that grew in the control plots  fed with traditional fertilisers  were small and weak   F However  measures like this are ot enough to solve the global soil degradation problem  To assess our options on a global scale we first eed an accurate picture of what types of soil are out there  and the problems they face  That s ot easy  For one thing  there is o agreed international system for classifying soil  In an attempt to unify the different approaches  the UN has created the Global Soil Map project  Researchers from ine countries are working together to create a map linked to a database that can be fed measurements from field surveys  drone surveys  satellite imagery  lab

very reason increasingly popular  Those who think in this way are oblivious to the vast philosophical literature in which the meaning and value of happiness have been explored and questioned  and write as if othing of any importance had been thought on the subject until it came to their attention  It was the philosopher Jeremy Bentham     who was more than anyone else responsible for the development of this way of thinking  For Bentham it was obvious that the human good consists of pleasure and the absence of pain  The Greek philosopher Aristotle may have identified happiness with self realisation in the th century BC  and thinkers throughout the ages may have struggled to reconcile the pursuit of happiness with other human values  but for Bentham all this was mere metaphysics or fiction  Without knowing anything much of him or the school of moral theory he established   since they are by education and intellectual conviction illiterate in the history of ideas   our advocates of positive psychology follow in his tracks in rejecting as outmoded and irrelevant pretty much the entirety of ethical reflection on human happiness to date  But as William Davies otes in his recent book The Happiness Industry  the view that happiness is the only self evident good is actually a way of limiting moral inquiry  One of the virtues of this rich  lucid and arresting book is that it places the current cult of happiness in a well defined historical framework  Rightly  Davies begins his story with Bentham  oting that he was far more than a philosopher  Davies writes   Bentham s activities were those which we might ow associate with a public sector management consultant   In the s  he wrote to the Home Office suggesting that the departments of government be linked together through a set of  conversation tubes   and to the Bank of England with a design for a printing device that could produce  " "X Test  uunforgenble banknotes  He drew up plans fora  Hrigidarium   Keep provisions suet  meat  fish  fruit and vegetables tresh  His celebrated design For at prison   be Known s tt Panoptigans  in which prisoners woutd be kept in solitary confinement while being visible ul all Uines t the guns  was very early adopted   Surprisingly  Davies does ot discuss the fet that Bentham meant his Panopticon ot just as  miodel prison but also as an instrument oF control that could jy applied fo schools and factories   Bentham was also a pioncer of the  selence of happiness   HE happiness is t be regarded as aseience  it has to be measured  and Bentham suggested two ways in which this might be done  Viewing happiness as a complex of pleasurable sensations  he suggested that it might be quantified by measuring the human pulse rite  Alternatively  money could be used as the standard for quantification  if two different goods have the same price  it can be claimed that they produce the same quantity of pleasure in the consumer  Bentham was more attracted by the latter measure  By associating money so closely to inner experience  Davies writes  Bentham  set the stage for the entangling of psychological research and capitalism that would shape the business practices of the tventieth century   The Happiness Industry describes how the project of a science of happiness has become integral to capitalism  We learn much that is interesting about how economic problems are being redefined and treated as psychological maladies  In addition  Davies shows how the belief that inner states of pleasure and displeasure can be objectively measured has informed management studies and advertising  The tendency of thinkers such as J B Watson  the founder of behaviourism   was that human beings could be shaped  or manipulated  by policymakers and managers  Watson had o factual basis for his view of human action  When he became president of the American Psychological Association in   he  had ever even studied a single human being   his research had been confined to experiments on white rats  Yet Watson s reductive model is ow widely applied  with  behaviour change  becoming the goal of governments  in Britain  a  Behaviour Insights Team  has been established by the government to study how people can be encouraged  ait minimum cost   the public purse  to live in what are considered to be socially desirable ways  Modern industrial societies appear to eed the possibility of ever increasing happiness to motivate them in their labours  But whatever its intellectual pedigree  the idea that governments should be responsible for promoting happiness is always a threat to human freedom      " "X Test  LISTENING SECTION  Questions   Complete the table below  Write ONE WORD AND OR A NUMBER for each answer  COOKERY CLASSES Cookery Class

Passage  below 

Case Study: Tourism New Zealand website

New Zealand is a small country of four million inhabitants, a long-haul flight from all the
major tourist-generating markets of the world  Tourism currently makes up % of the
country�s gross domestic product, and is the country�s largest export sector  Unlike other
export sectors, which make products and then sell them overseas, tourism brings its
customers to New Zealand  The product is the country itself � the people, the places and
the experiences  In , Tourism New Zealand launched a campaign to communicate
a new brand position to the world  The campaign focused on New Zealand's scenic
beauty, exhilarating outdoor activities and authentic Maori culture, and it made New
Zealand one of the strongest national brands in the world 

Akey feature of the campaign was the website www ewzealand com, which provided
potential visitors to New Zealand with a single gateway to everything the destination had
to offer  The heart of the website was a database of tourism services operators, both
those based in New Zealand and those based abroad which offered tourism services to
the country  Any tourism-related business could be listed by filling in a simple form  This
meant that even the smallest bed and breakfast address or specialist activity provider
could gain a web presence with access to an audience of long-haul visitors  In addition,
because participating businesses were able to update the details they gave ona

regular basis, the information provided remained accurate  And to maintain and improve
standards, Tourism New Zealand organised a scheme whereby organisations appearing
on the website underwent an independent evaluation against a set of agreed national
standards of quality  As part of this, the effect of each business on the environment was
considered

To communicate the New Zealand experience, the site also carried features relating
to famous people and places  One of the most popular was an interview with former
New Zealand All Blacks rugby captain Tana Umaga  Another feature that attracted a

lot of attention was an interactive journey through a number of the locations chosen
for blockbuster films which had made use of New Zealand's stunning scenery as a
backdrop  As the site developed, additional features were added to help independent
travellers devise their own customised itineraries  To make it easier to plan motoring
holidays, the site catalogued the most popular driving routes in the country, highlighting
different routes according to the season and indicating distances and times 


" "Reading
Leter, a Travel Planner feature was added, which allowed visitors to click and �bookmark�
places or attractions they were interested in, and then view the results on a map  The
Travel Planner offered suggested routes and public transport options between the
chosen locations  There were also links to accommodation in the area  By registering
with the website, users could save their Travel Plan and return to it later, or print it out
�> take on the visit  The website also had a �Your Words� section where anyone could
submit a blog of their New Zealand travels for possible inclusion on the website 
The Tourism New Zealand website won two Webby awards for online achievement
nd innovation  More importantly perhaps, the growth of tourism to New Zealand was
impressive  Overall tourism expenditure increased by an average of  % per year
between  and   From Britain, visits to New Zealand grew at an average annual
rate of % between  and , compared to a rate of % overall for British
wisits abroad 
The website was set up to allow both individuals and travel organisations to create
ineraries and travel packages to suit their own needs and interests  On the website,
wisitors can search for activities not solely by geographical location, but also by the
particular nature of the activity  This is important as research shows that activities are the
key driver of visitor satisfaction, contributing % to visitor satisfaction, while transport
and accommodation account for the remaining %  The more activities that visitors
undertake, the more satisfied they will be  It has also been found that visitors enjoy
cultural activities most when they are interactive, such as visiting a marae (meeting
ground) to learn about traditional Maori life  Many long-haul travellers enjoy such
jearning experiences, which provide them with stories to take home to their friends and
family  In addition, it appears that visitors to New Zealand don't want to be �one of the
crowd� and find activities that involve only a few people more special and meaningful 
ft could be argued that New Zealand is not a typical destination  New Zealand is a small
country with a visitor economy composed mainly of small businesses  It is generally
perceived as a safe English-speaking country with a reliable transport infrastructure 
Because of the long-haul flight, most visitors stay for longer (average  days) and want
to see as much of the country as possible on what is often seen as a once-in-a-lifetime
visit  However, the underlying lessons apply anywhere � the effectiveness of a strong
brand, a strategy based on unique experiences and a comprehensive and user-friendly
website

Why being bored is stimulating � and useful, too
This most common of emotions is turning out to be more interesting than
we thought
#% We all know how it feels � it's impossible to keep your mind on anything, time
stretches out, and all the things you could do seem equally unlikely to make you
feel better  But defining boredom so that it can be studied in the lab has proved
difficult  For a start, it can include a lot of other mental states, such as frustration,
apathy, depression and indifference  There isn't even agreement over whether
boredom is always a low-energy, flat kind of emotion or whether feeling agitated
and restless counts as boredom, too  In his book, Boredom: A Lively History, Peter
Toohey at the University of Calgary, Canada, compares it to disgust � an emotion
that motivates us to stay away from certain situations  �If disgust protects humans
from infection, boredom may protect them from �infectious� social situations,�
he suggests 
= By asking people about their experiences of boredom, Thomas Goetz and his team
at the University of Konstanz in Germany have recently identified five distinct types:
indifferent, calibrating, searching, reactant and apathetic  These can be plotted on
two axes � one running left to right, which measures low to high arousal, and the
other from top to bottom, which measures how positive or negative the feeling is 
Intriguingly, Goetz has found that while people experience all kinds of boredom,
they tend to specialise in one  Of the five types, the most damaging is �reactant�
boredom with its explosive combination of high arousal and negative emotion  The
most useful is what Goetz calls �indifferent� boredom: someone isn't engaged in
| anything satisfying but still feels relaxed and calm  However, it remains to be seen
| whether there are any character traits that predict the kind of boredom each of us
| might be prone to 
� Psychologist Sandi Mann at the University of Central Lancashire, UK, goes further 
�All emotions are there for a reason, including boredom,� she says  Mann has found
that being bored makes us more creative  �We're all afraid of being bored but in
actual fact it can lead to all kinds of amazing things,� she says  In experiments
published last year, Mann found that people who had been made to feel bored by
copying numbers out of the phone book for  minutes came up with more creative
ideas about how to use a polystyrene cup than a control group  Mann concluded
that a passive, boring activity is best for creativity because it allows the mind
to wander  In fact, she goes so far as to suggest that we should seek out more
boredom in our lives 
D Psychologist John Eastwood at York University in Toronto, Canada, isn't convinced
�If you are in a state of mind-wandering you are not bored,� he says  �In my view,
by definition boredom is an undesirable state � That doesn�t necessarily mean
that it isn't adaptive, he adds  �Pain is adaptive � if we didn�t have physical pain,
bad things would happen to us  Does that mean that we should actively cause
pain? No  But even if boredom has evolved to help us survive, it can still be toxic

" "Test 
if allowed to fester � For Eastwood, the central feature of boredom is a failure to
put our �attention system� into gear  This causes an inability to focus on anything,
which makes time seem to go painfully slowly  What's more, your efforts to improve
the situation can end up making you feel worse  �People try to connect with the
world and if they are not successful there's that frustration and irritability,� he says 
Perhaps most worryingly, says Eastwood, repeatedly failing to engage attention
can lead to a state where we don't know what to do any more, and no longer care 

E Eastwood's team is now trying to explore why the attention system fails  It's early
days but they think that at least some of it comes down to personality  Boredom
proneness has been linked with a variety of traits  People who are motivated by
pleasure seem to suffer particularly badly  Other personality traits, such as curiosity,
are associated with a high boredom threshold  More evidence that boredom has
detrimental effects comes from studies of people who are more or less prone to
boredom  It seems those who bore easily face poorer prospects in education,
their career and even life in general  But of course, boredom itself cannot kill �
it's the things we do to deal with it that may put us in danger  What can we do to
alleviate it before it comes to that? Goetz's group has one suggestion  Working with
teenagers, they found that those who �approach� a boring situation � in other words,
see that it's boring and get stuck in anyway � report less boredom than those who
try to avoid it by using snacks, TV or social media for distraction 

F Psychologist Francoise Wemelsfelder speculates that our over-connected lifestyles
might even be a new source of boredom  �In modern human society there is a lot of
overstimulation but still a lot of problems finding meaning,� she says  So instead of
seeking yet more mental stimulation, perhaps we should leave our phones alone,
and use boredom to motivate us to engage with the world in a more
meaningful way

Passage  below 
Artificial artists
Can computers really create works of art?
The Painting Fool is one of a growing number of computer programs which, so their
makers claim, possess creative talents  Classical music by an artificial composer has 
had audiences enraptured, and even tricked them into believing a human was behind
the score  Artworks painted by a robot have sold for thousands of dollars and been hung
in prestigious galleries  And software has been built which creates art that could not
have been imagined by the programmer 
Human beings are the only species to perform sophisticated creative acts regularly 
If we can break this process down into computer code, where does that leave human
creativity? �This is a question at the very core of humanity,� says Geraint Wiggins, a
computational creativity researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London  �It scares a lot
of people  They are worried that it is taking something special away from what it means
to be human �
To some extent, we are alll familiar with computerised art  The question is: where does
the work of the artist stop and the creativity of the computer begin? Consider one of the
oldest machine artists, Aaron, a robot that has had paintings exhibited in London's Tate
Modem and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art  Aaron can pick up a paintbrush
and paint on canvas on its own  Impressive perhaps, but itis still little more than a tool to
realise the programmer's own creative ideas 
Simon Colton, the designer of the Painting Fool, is keen to make sure his creation
doesn't attract the same criticism  Unlike earlier �artists� such as Aaron, the Painting Fool
only needs minimal direction and can come up with its own concepts by going online for
material  The software runs its own web searches and trawis through social media sites 
It is now beginning to display a kind of imagination too, creating pictures from scratch 
One of its original works is a series of fuzzy landscapes, depicting trees and sky  While
some might say they have a mechanical look, Colton argues that such reactions arise
from people's double standards towards software-produced and human-produced
art  After all, he says, consider that the Painting Fool painted the landscapes without
referring to a photo  �Ifa child painted a new scene from its head, you'd say it has a
certain level of imagination,� he points out  �The same should be true of a machine �
Software bugs can also lead to unexpected results  Some of the Painting Fool's
Paintings of a chair came out in black and white, thanks to a technical glitch  This gives
the work an eerie, ghostlike quality  Human artists like the renowned Ellsworth Kelly are
lauded for limiting their colour palette - so why should computers be any different?

" "Reading 
Researchers like Colton don't believe it is right to measure machine creativity directly
to that of humans who �have had millennia to develop our skills�, Others, though, are
fascinated by the prospect thal w computer might create something as original and
subtle as our best artists  So far, only one has come close  Composer David Cope
invented a program called Experiments in Musical intelligence, or EMI  Not only did
EMI create compositions in Cope�s style, but also that of the most revered classical
composers, including Bach, Chopin and Mozart  Audiences were moved to tears, and
EMI even fooled classical music experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach 
Not everyone was impressed however  Some, such as Wiggins, have blasted Cope's
work as pseudoscience, and condemned him for his deliberately vague explanation of
how the software worked  Meanwhile, Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University said
EMI created replicas which still rely completely on the original artist's creative impulses 
When audiences found out the truth they were often outraged with Cope, and one music
lover even tried to punch him  Amid such controversy, Cope destroyed EMI's
vital databases
But why did so many people love the music, yet recoil when they discovered how it
was composed? A study by computer scientist David Moffat of Glasgow Caledonian
University provides a clue  He asked both expert musicians and non-experts to assess
six compositions  The participants weren't told beforehand whether the tunes were
composed by humans or computers, but were asked to guess, and then rate how much
they liked each one  People who thought the composer was a computer tended to dislike
the piece more than those who believed it was human  This was true even among the
experts, who might have been expected to be more objective in their analyses 
Where does this prejudice come from? Paul Bloom of Yale University has a suggestion
he reckons part of the pleasure we get from art stems from the creative process behind
the work  This can give it an �irresistible essence�, says Bloom  Meanwhile, experiments
by Justin Kruger of New York University have shown that people's enjoyment of an
artwork increases if they think more time and effort was needed to create it  Similarly,
Colton thinks that when people experience art, they wonder what the artist might have
been thinking or what the artist is trying to tell them  It seems obvious, therefore, that
with computers producing art, this speculation is cut short � there's nothing to explore 
But as technology becomes increasingly complex, finding those greater depths in
computer art could become possible  This is precisely why Colton asks the Painting
Fool to tap into online social networks for its inspiration: hopefully this way it will choose
themes that will already be meaningful to us

Passage  below 

Bringing cinnamon to Europe

Cinnamon is a sweet, fragrant spice produced from the inner bark of trees of the genus
Cinnamomum, which is native to the Indian sub-continent  It was known in biblical times,
and is mentioned in several books of the Bible, both as an ingredient that was mixed
with oils for anointing people's bodies, and also as a token indicating friendship among
lovers and friends  In ancient Rome, mourners attending funerals burnt cinnamon to
create a pleasant scent  Most often, however, the spice found its primary use as an
additive to food and drink  In the Middle Ages, Europeans who could afford the spice
used it to flavour food, particularly meat, and to impress those around them with their
ability to purchase an expensive condiment from the �exotic� East  At a banquet, a host
would offer guests a plate with various spices piled upon it as a sign of the wealth at his
or her disposal  Cinnamon was also reported to have health benefits, and was thought
to cure various ailments, such as indigestion

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the European middle classes began to desire

the lifestyle of the elite, including their consumption of spices  This led to a growth in
demand for cinnamon and other spices  At that time, cinnamon was transported by Arab
merchants, who closely guarded the secret of the source of the spice from potential
rivals  They took it from India, where it was grown, on camels via an overland route

to the Mediterranean  Their journey ended when they reached Alexandria  European
traders sailed there to purchase their supply of cinnamon, then brought it back to Venice 
The spice then travelled from that great trading city to markets all around Europe 
Because the overland trade route allowed for only small quantities of the spice to reach
Europe, and because Venice had a virtual monopoly of the trade, the Venetians could
set the price of cinnamon exorbitantly high  These prices, coupled with the increasing
demand, spurred the search for new routes to Asia by Europeans eager to take part in
the spice trade 

Seeking the high profits promised by the cinnamon market, Portuguese traders arrived
on the island of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean toward the end of the th century  Before
Europeans arrived on the island, the state had organized the cultivation of cinnamon 
People belonging to the ethnic group called the Salagama would peel the bark off
young shoots of the cinnamon plant in the rainy season, when the wet bark was

more pliable  During the peeling process, they curled the bark into the �stick� shape

still associated with the spice today  The Salagama then gave the finished product to
the king as a form of tribute  When the Portuguese arrived, they needed to increase

" "Reading
production significantly, and so enslaved many other members of the Ceylonese native
population, forcing them to work in cinnamon harvesting  In , the Portuguese built
a fort on Ceylon, which enabled them to protect the island, so helping them to develop a
monopoly in the cinnamon trade and generate very high profits  In the late th century,
for example, they enjoyed a tenfold profit when shipping cinnamon over a journey of
eight days from Ceylon to India 

When the Dutch arrived off the coast of southern Asia at the very beginning of the
th century, they set their sights on displacing the Portuguese as kings of cinnamon 
The Dutch allied themselves with Kandy, an inland kingdom on Ceylon  In return
for payments of elephants and cinnamon, they protected the native king from the
Portuguese  By , the Dutch broke the -year Portuguese monopoly when they
overran and occupied their factories  By , they had permanently expelled the
Portuguese from the island, thereby gaining control of the lucrative cinnamon trade 
In order to protect their hold on the market, the Dutch, like the Portuguese before them,
treated the native inhabitants harshly  Because of the need to boost production and
satisfy Europe's ever-increasing appetite for cinnamon, the Dutch began to alter the
harvesting practices of the Ceylonese  Over time, the supply of cinnamon trees on the
island became nearly exhausted, due to systematic stripping of the bark  Eventually, the
Dutch began cultivating their own cinnamon trees to supplement the diminishing number
of wild trees available for use 
Then, in , the English arrived on Ceylon, thereby displacing the Dutch from their
control of the cinnamon monopoly  By the middle of the th century, production of
cinnamon reached , tons a year, after a lower grade quality of the spice became
acceptable to European tastes  By that time, cinnamon was being grown in other parts
of the Indian Ocean region and in the West Indies, Brazil, and Guyana  Not only was a
Monopoly of cinnamon becoming impossible, but the spice trade overall was diminishing
in �conomic potential, and was eventually superseded by the rise of trade in coffee, tea,
chocolate, and sugar

Passage  below 

Oxytocin
The positive and negative effects of the chemical known as the �love hormone�

A Oxytocin is a chemical, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland in the brain  It
was through various studies focusing on animals that scientists first became aware
of the influence of oxytocin  They discovered that it helps reinforce the bonds
between prairie voles, which mate for life, and triggers the motherly behaviour
that sheep show towards their newborn lambs  It is also released by women in
childbirth, strengthening the attachment between mother and baby  Few chemicals
have as positive a reputation as oxytocin, which is sometimes referred to as the
�love hormone�  One sniff of it can, it is claimed, make a person more trusting,
empathetic, generous and cooperative  It is time, however, to revise this wholly
optimistic view  A new wave of studies has shown that its effects vary greatly
depending on the person and the circumstances, and it can impact on our social
interactions for worse as well as for better 

B � Oxytocin�s role in human behaviour first emerged in   In a groundbreaking
experiment, Markus Heinrichs and his colleagues at the University of Freiburg,
Germany, asked volunteers to do an activity in which they could invest money with
an anonymous person who was not guaranteed to be honest  The team found
that participants who had sniffed oxytocin via a nasal spray beforehand invested
more money than those who received a placebo instead  The study was the start
of research into the effects of oxytocin on human interactions  �For eight years, it
was quite a lonesome field,� Heinrichs recalls  �Now, everyone is interested � These
follow-up studies have shown that after a sniff of the hormone, people become
more charitable, better at reading emotions on others� faces and at communicating
constructively in arguments  Together, the results fuelled the view that oxytocin
universally enhanced the positive aspects of our social nature 

C Then, after a few years, contrasting findings began to emerge  Simone Shamay-
Tsoory at the University of Haifa, Israel, found that when volunteers played a
competitive game, those who inhaled the hormone showed more pleasure when
they beat other players, and felt more envy when others won  What's more,
administering oxytocin also has sharply contrasting outcomes depending on a
person's disposition  Jennifer Bartz from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New |
York, found that it improves people's ability to read emotions, but only if they are
not very socially adept to begin with  Her research also shows that oxytocin in fact
reduces cooperation in subjects who are particularly anxious or sensitive
to rejection 


" "Reading
Another discovery is that oxytocin�s effects vary depending on who we are
interacting with  Studies conducted by Carolyn DeClerck of the University of
Antwerp, Belgium, revealed that People who had received a dose of oxytocin
actually became less cooperative when dealing with complete strangers 
Meanwhile, Carsten De Dreu at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands
discovered that volunteers given oxytocin showed favouritism: Dutch men became
quicker to associate positive words with Dutch names than with foreign ones,
for example  According to De Dreu, oxytocin drives people to care for those in
their social circles and defend them from outside dangers  So, it appears that
oxytocin strengthens biases, rather than promoting general goodwill, as was
previously thought 
There were signs of these subtleties from the start  Bartz has recently shown that
in almost half of the existing research results, oxytocin influenced only certain
individuals or in certain circumstances  Where once researchers took no notice
of such findings, now a more nuanced understanding of oxytocin�s effects is
propelling investigations down new lines  To Bartz, the key to understanding what
the hormone does lies in pinpointing its core function rather than in cataloguing its
seemingly endless effects  There are several hypotheses which are not mutually
exclusive  Oxytocin could help to reduce anxiety and fear  Or it could simply
motivate people to seek out social connections  She believes that oxytocin acts as
a chemical spotlight that shines on social clues � a shift in posture, a flicker of the
eyes, a dip in the voice � making people more attuned to their social environment 
This would explain why it makes us more likely to look others in the eye and
improves our ability to identify emotions  But it could also make things worse for
people who are overly sensitive or Prone to interpreting social cues in the
worst light 

F Perhaps we should not be surprised that the oxytocin story has become more
perplexing  The hormone is found in everything from octopuses to sheep, and its
evolutionary roots stretch back half a billion years  �It's a very simple and ancient
molecule that has been co-opted for many different functions,� says Sue Carter at
the University of Illinois, Chicago, USA  �It affects Primitive parts of the brain like
the amygdala, so it's going to have many effects on just about everything � Bartz
agrees  �Oxytocin probably does some very basic things, but once you add our
higher-order thinking and social situations, these basic Processes could manifest
in different ways depending on individual differences and context �

Passage  below 

MAKING THE MOST OF TRENDS
Experts from Harvard Business School give advice to managers

Most managers can identify the major trends of the day  But in the course of conducting research
in a number of industries and working directly with companies, we have discovered that
managers often fail to recognize the less obvious but profound ways these trends are influencing
consumers� aspirations, attitudes, and behaviors  This is especially true of trends that managers
view as peripheral to their core markets 

Many ignore trends in their innovation strategies or adopt a wait-and-see approach and let
competitors take the lead  At a minimum, such responses mean missed profit opportunities  At
the extreme, they can jeopardize a company by ceding to rivals the opportunity to transform the
industry  The purpose of this article is twofold: to spur managers to think more expansively about
how trends could engender new value propositions in their core markets, and to provide some
high-level advice on how to make market research and product development personnel more
adept at analyzing and exploiting trends 

One strategy, known as �infuse and augment�, is to design a product or service that retains most
of the attributes and functions of existing products in the category but adds others that address
the needs and desires unleashed by a major trend  A case in point is the Poppy range of handbags,
which the firm Coach created in response to the economic downtum of   The Coach brand
had been a symbol of opulence and luxury for nearly  years, and the most obvious reaction

to the downturn would have been to lower prices  However, that would have risked cheapening
the brand�s image  Instead, they initiated a consumer-research project which revealed that
customers were eager to lift themselves and the country out of tough times  Using these insights,
Coach launched the lower-priced Poppy handbags, which were in vibrant colors, and looked
more youthfill and playful than conventional Coach products  Creating the sub-brand allowed
Coach to avert an across-the-board price cut  In contrast to the many companies that responded
to the recession by cutting prices, Coach saw the new consumer mindset as an opportunity for
innovation and renewal 

A further example of this strategy was supermarket Tesco�s response to consumers� growing
concerns about the environment  With that in mind, Tesco, one of the world�s top five retailers,
introduced its Greener Living program, which demonstrates the company�s commitment to
protecting the environment by involving consumers in ways that produce tangible results  For
example, Tesco customers can accumulate points for such activities as reusing bags, recycling
cans and printer cartridges, and buying home-insulation materials  Like points earned on regular
purchases, these green points can be redeemed for cash  Tesco has not abandoned its traditional
retail offerings but augmented its business with these innovations, thereby infusing its value
proposition with a green streak 

" "Reading
A more radical strategy is �combine and transcend�  This entails combining aspects of the
product�s existing value proposition with attributes addressing changes arising from a trend, to
create a novel experience ~ one that may land the company in an entirely new market space 
At first glance, spending resources to incorporate elements of a seemingly irrelevant trend into
one�s core offerings sounds like it�s hardly worthwhile  But consider Nike's move to integrate the
digital revolution into its reputation for high-performance athletic footwear  In , they teamed
up with technology company Apple to launch Nike+, a digital sports kit comprising a sensor
that attaches to the running shoe and a wireless receiver that connects to the user's iPod  By
combining Nike�s original value proposition for amateur athletes with one for digital consumers,
the Nike+ sports kit and web interface moved the company from a focus on athletic apparel to a
new plane of engagement with its customers 
A third approach, known as �counteract and reaffirm�, involves developing products or services
that stress the values traditionally associated with the category in ways that allow consumers to 
oppose ~ or at least temporarily escape from ~ the aspects of trends they view as undesirable 
A product that accomplished this is the ME, a video game created by Canada�s �Toys  By
reaffirming the toy category's association with physical play, the ME counteracted some of
the widely perceived negative impacts of digital gaming devices  Like other handheld games 
the device featured a host of exciting interactive games, a full-color LCD screen, and advanced
D graphics  What set it apart was that it incorporated the traditional physical component
of children�s play: it contained a pedometer, which tracked and awarded points for physical
activity (walking, running, biking, skateboarding, climbing stairs)  The child could use the
points to enhance various virtual skills needed for the video game  �The ME, introduced in mid-
, catered to kids� huge desire to play video games while countering the negatives  such as
associations with lack of exercise and obesity 
Once you have gained perspective on how trend-related changes in consumer opinions and
behaviors impact on your category, you can determine which of our three innovation strategies to
pursue, When your category�s basic value proposition continues to be meaningful for consumers
influenced by the trend, the infuse-and-augment strategy will allow you to reinvigorate the
category  If analysis reveals an increasing disparity between your category and consumers� new
focus, your innovations need to transcend the category to integrate the wo worlds  Finally,
if aspects of the category clash with undesired outcomes of a trend, such as associations with
unhealthy lifestyles, there is an opportunity to counteract those changes by reaffirming the core
values of your category 
Trends � technological, economic, environmental, social, or political ~ that affect how people
perceive the world around them and shape what they expect from products and services present
firms with unique opportunities for growth

Passage  below 

The coconut palm

For millennia, the coconut has been central to the lives of Polynesian and Asian peoples 
In the western world, on the other hand, coconuts have always been exotic and unusual,
sometimes rare  The Italian merchant traveller Marco Polo apparently saw coconuts

in South Asia in the late th century, and among the mid-th-century travel writings

of Sir John Mandeville there is mention of �great Notes of Ynde' (great Nuts of India) 
Today, images of palm-fringed tropical beaches are clich�s in the west to sell holidays,
chocolate bars, fizzy drinks and even romance 

Typically, we envisage coconuts as brown cannonballs that, when opened, provide
sweet white flesh  But we see only part of the fruit and none of the plant from which they
come  The coconut palm has a smooth, slender, grey trunk, up to  metres tall  This

is an important source of timber for building houses, and is increasingly being used as

a replacement for endangered hardwoods in the furniture construction industry  The
trunk is surmounted by a rosette of leaves, each of which may be up to six metres long 
The leaves have hard veins in their centres which, in many parts of the world, are used
as brushes after the green part of the leaf has been stripped away  Immature coconut
flowers are tightly clustered together among the leaves at the top of the trunk  The flower
stems may be tapped for their sap to produce a drink, and the sap can also be reduced
by boiling to produce a type of sugar used for cooking

Coconut palms produce as many as seventy fruits per year, weighing more than a
kilogram each  The wall of the fruit has three layers: a waterproof outer layer, a fibrous
middle layer and a hard, inner layer  The thick fibrous middle layer produces coconut
fibre, �coir�, which has numerous uses and is particularly important in manufacturing
ropes  The woody innermost layer, the shell, with its three prominent �eyes�, surrounds
the seed  An important product obtained from the shell is charcoal, which is widely used
in various industries as well as in the home as a cooking fuel  When broken in half, the
shells are also used as bowls in many parts of Asia 

Inside the shell are the nutrients (endosperm) needed by the developing seed  Initially,
the endosperm is a sweetish liquid, coconut water, which is enjoyed as a drink, but also
provides the hormones which encourage other plants to grow more rapidly and produce
higher yields  As the fruit matures, the coconut water gradually solidifies to form the
brilliant white, fat-rich, edible flesh or meat  Dried coconut flesh, �copra�, is made into
coconut oil and coconut milk, which are widely used in cooking in different parts of the
world, as well as in cosmetics  A derivative of coconut fat, glycerine, acquired strategic

" "Reading
importance in a quite different sphere, as Alfred Nobel introduced the world to his
nitroglycerine-based invention: dynamite 

Their biology would appear to make coconuts the great maritime voyagers and coastal
colonizers of the plant world  The large, energy-rich fruits are able to float in water and
tolerate salt, but cannot remain viable indefinitely; studies suggest after about  days
at sea they are no longer able to germinate  Literally cast onto desert island shores,
with little more than sand to grow in and exposed to the full glare of the tropical sun,
coconut seeds are able to germinate and root  The air pocket in the seed, created as the
endosperm solidifies, protects the embryo  In addition, the fibrous fruit wall that helped
it to float during the voyage stores moisture that can be taken up by the roots of the
coconut seedling as it starts to grow 
There have been centuries of academic debate over the origins of the coconut  There
were no coconut palms in West Africa, the Caribbean or the east coast of the Americas
before the voyages of the European explorers Vasco da Gama and Columbus in the
late th and early th centuries  th century trade and human migration patterns
reveal that Arab traders and European sailors are likely to have moved coconuts from
South and Southeast Asia to Africa and then across the Atlantic to the east coast of
America  But the origin of coconuts discovered along the west coast of America by
th century sailors has been the subject of centuries of discussion  Two diametrically
opposed origins have been proposed: that they came from Asia, or that they were native
to America  Both suggestions have problems  In Asia, there is a large degree of coconut
diversity and evidence of millennia of human use � but there are no relatives growing
in the wild  In America, there are close coconut relatives, but no evidence that coconuts
are indigenous  These problems have led to the intriguing suggestion that coconuts
originated on coral islands in the Pacific and were dispersed from there

Passage  below 

How baby talk gives infant brains a boost

A The typical way of talking to a baby � high-pitched, exaggerated and repetitious � is
a source of fascination for linguists who hope to understand how �baby talk� impacts 
on learning  Most babies start developing their hearing while still in the womb,
prompting some hopeful parents to play classical music to their pregnant bellies 
Some research even suggests that infants are listening to adult speech as early
as  weeks before being born, gathering the basic building blocks of their family�s
native tongue 

B Early language exposure seems to have benefits to the brain � for instance, studies
suggest that babies raised in bilingual homes are better at learning how to mentally
prioritize information  So how does the sweet if sometimes absurd sound of infant-
directed speech influence a baby's development? Here are some recent studies
that explore the science behind baby talk 

C Fathers don't use baby talk as often or in the same ways as mothers � and that's
perfectly OK, according to a new study  Mark VanDam of Washington State
University at Spokane and colleagues equipped parents with recording devices and
speech-recognition software to study the way they interacted with their youngsters
during a normal day  �We found that moms do exactly what you'd expect and what's
been described many times over,� VanDam explains  �But we found that dads aren't
doing the same thing  Dads didn�t raise their pitch or fundamental frequency when
they talked to kids � Their role may be rooted in what is called the bridge hypothesis,
which dates back to   It suggests that fathers use less familial language to
provide their children with a bridge to the kind of speech they'll hear in public  �The
idea is that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and another
kind of speech with dad, so the kid then has a wider repertoire of kinds of speech to
practice,� says VanDam 

D Scientists from the University of Washington and the University of Connecticut
collected thousands of -second conversations between parents and their babies,
fitting  children with audio-recording vests that captured language and sound
during a typical eight-hour day  The study found that the more baby talk parents
used, the more their youngsters began to babble  And when researchers saw
the same babies at age two, they found that frequent baby talk had dramatically
boosted vocabulary, regardless of socioeconomic status  �Those children who
listened to a lot of baby talk were talking more than the babies that listened to more


" "Reading
adult talk or standard speech,� says Nairan Ramirez-Esparza of the University of
Connecticut  �We also found that it really matters whether you use baby talk ina
one-on-one context,� she adds  �The more parents use baby talk one-on-one, the
more babies babble, and the more they babble, the more words they produce later
in life �

= Another study suggests that parents might want to pair their youngsters up so
they can babble more with their own kind  Researchers from McGill University
and Universit� du Qu�bec a Montr�al found that babies seem to like listening to
each other rather than to adults � which may be why baby talk is such a universal
tool among parents  They played repeating vowel sounds made by a special
synthesizing device that mimicked sounds made by either an adult woman or
another baby  This way, only the impact of the auditory cues was observed  The
team then measured how long each type of sound held the infants� attention  They
found that the �infant� sounds held babies� attention nearly  percent longer  The
: baby noises also induced more reactions in the listening infants, like smiling or lip
moving, which approximates sound making  The team theorizes that this attraction
to other infant sounds could help launch the learning process that leads to �speech 
�It may be some property of the sound that is just drawing their attention,� says
study co-author Linda Polka  �Or maybe they are really interested in that particular
type of sound because they are starting to focus on their own ability to make
sounds  We are speculating here but it might catch their attention because they
recognize it as a sound they could possibly make �
= Ina study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a total
of  babies from two slightly different age groups � seven months and eleven and
a half months � were played a number of syllables from both their native language
(English) and a non-native tongue (Spanish)  The infants were placed in a brain-
activation scanner that recorded activity in a brain region known to guide the motor
movements that produce speech  The results suggest that listening to baby talk
Prompts infant brains to start practicing their language skills  �Finding activation in
motor areas of the brain when infants are simply listening is significant, because
; it means the baby brain is engaged in trying to talk back right from the start and
suggests that seven-month-olds� brains are already trying to figure out how to make
the right movements that will produce words,� says co-author Patricia Kuhl  Another
interesting finding was that while the seven-month-olds responded to all speech
sounds regardless of language, the brains of the older infants worked harder at the
motor activations of non-native sounds compared to native sounds  The study may
have also uncovered a process by which babies recognize differences between
their native language and other tongues

Passage  below 

Whatever happened to the Harappan Civilisation?
�New research sheds light on the disappearance of an ancient society

A The Harappan Civilisation of ancient Pakistan and India flourished , years
ago, but a thousand years later their cities were abandoned  The Harappan
Civilisation was a sophisticated Bronze Age society who built �megacities� and
traded internationally in luxury craft products, and yet seemed to have left almost |
no depictions of themselves  But their lack of self-imagery - at a time when the
Egyptians were carving and painting representations of themselves all over their
temples � is only part of the mystery 

B �There is plenty of archaeological evidence to tell us about the rise of the Harappan
Civilisation, but relatively little about its fall,� explains archaeologist Dr Cameron
Petrie of the University of Cambridge  �As populations increased, cities were
built that had great baths, craft workshops, palaces and halls laid out in distinct
sectors  Houses were arranged in blocks, with wide main streets and narrow
alleyways, and many had their own wells and drainage systems  It was very much
a �thriving� civilisation � Then around  BC, a transformation began  Streets
went uncleaned, buildings started to be abandoned, and ritual structures fell out of
use  After their final demise, a millennium passed before really large-scale cities
appeared once more in South Asia 

C Some have claimed that major glacier-fed rivers changed their course, dramatically

affecting the water supply and agriculture; or that the cities could not cope with an
increasing population, they exhausted their resource base, the trading economy
broke down or they succumbed to invasion and conflict; and yet others that climate
change caused an environmental change that affected food and water provision 
�It is unlikely that there was a single cause for the decline of the civilisation  But the
fact is, until now, we have had little solid evidence from the area for most of the key
elements,� said Petrie  �A lot of the archaeological debate has really only been well-
argued speculation �

D  Aresearch team led by Petrie, together with Dr Ravindanath Singh of Banaras
Hindu University in India, found early in their investigations that many of the
archaeological sites were not where they were supposed to be, completely altering
understanding of the way that this region was inhabited in the past  When they
carried out a survey of how the larger area was settled in relation to sources of
water, they found inaccuracies in the published geographic locations of ancient
settlements ranging from several hundred metres to many kilometres  They realised


" "Reading
that any attempts to use the existing data were likely to be fundamentally flawed 
Over the course of several seasons of fieldwork they carried out new surveys,
finding an astonishing  settlement sites that were previously unknown 

E Now, research published by Dr Yama Dixit and Professor David Hodell, both
from Cambridge�s Department of Earth Sciences, has provided the first definitive

: evidence for climate change affecting the plains of north-western India, where
hundreds of Harappan sites are known to have been situated  The researchers
gathered shells of Melanoides tuberculata snails from the sediments of an ancient
lake and used geochemical analysis as a means of tracing the climate history of
the region  �As today, the major source of water into the lake is likely to have been
the summer monsoon,� says Dixit  �But we have observed that there was an abrupt
change about , years ago, when the amount of evaporation from the lake
exceeded the rainfall � indicative of a drought � Hodell adds: �We estimate that the
weakening of the Indian summer monsoon climate lasted about  years before
recovering to the previous conditions, which we still see today �

F It has long been thought that other great Bronze Age civilisations also declined at
a similar time, with a global-scale climate event being seen as the cause  While it
is possible that these local-scale processes were linked, the real archaeological
interest lies in understanding the impact of these larger-scale events on different
environments and different populations  �Considering the vast area of the Harappan
Civilisation with its variable weather systems,� explains Singh, �it is essential that we
obtain more climate data from areas close to the two great cities at Mohenjodaro
and Harappa and also from the Indian Punjab �

G Petrie and Singh�s team is now examining archaeological records and trying to
understand details of how people led their lives in the region five millennia ago 
They are analysing grains cultivated at the time, and trying to work out whether
they were grown under extreme conditions of water stress, and whether they
were adjusting the combinations of crops they were growing for different weather
systems  They are also looking at whether the types of pottery used, and other
aspects of their material culture, were distinctive to specific regions or were more
similar across larger areas  This gives us insight into the types of interactive
networks that the population was involved in, and whether those changed 

H Petrie believes that archaeologists are in a unique position to investigate how
past societies responded to environmental and climatic change  �By investigating
responses to environmental pressures and threats, we can learn from the past to
engage with the public, and the relevant governmental and administrative bodies,
to be more proactive in issues such as the management and administration of
water supply, the balance of urban and rural development, and the importance of
preserving cultural heritage in the future �

Passage  below 

Cutty Sark: the fastest sailing ship of all time
The nineteenth century was a period of great technological development in Britain, and for
shipping the major changes were from wind to steam power, and from wood to iron and steel 
The fastest commercial sailing vessels of all time were clippers, three-masted ships built to
transport goods around the world, although some also took passengers  From the s until
, when the Suez Canal opened and steam propulsion was replacing sail, clippers dominated
world trade, Although many were built, only one has survived more or less intact: Cutty Sark,
now on display in Greenwich, southeast London 
Cutty Sark�s unusual name comes from the poem Tam O'Shanter by the Scottish poet Robert
Burns  Tam, a farmer, is chased by a witch called Nannie, who is wearing a �cufty sark� �an
old Scottish name for a short nightdress  The witch is depicted in Cutty Sark�s figurehead � the
carving of a woman typically at the front of old sailing ships  In legend, and in Burns�s poem,
witches cannot cross water, so this was a rather strange choice of name for a ship 
Cutty Sark was built in Dumbarton, Scotland, in , for a shipping company owned by John
Willis  To carry out construction, Willis chose a new shipbuilding firm, Scott & Linton, and
ensured that the contract with them put him in a very strong position  In the end, the firm was
forced out of business, and the ship was finished by a competitor 
Willis�s company was active in the tea trade between China and Britain, where speed could
bring shipowners both profits and prestige, so Cuity Sark was designed to make the journey
more quickly than any other ship  On her maiden voyage, in , she set sail from London,
carrying large amounts of goods to China, She returned laden with tea, making the journey back
to London in four months  However, Cutty Sark never lived up to the high expectations of her
�owner, as a result of bad winds and various misfortunes  On one occasion, in , the ship and
a rival clipper, Thermopylae, left port in China on the same day  Crossing the Indian Ocean,
Cutty Sark gained a lead of over  miles, but then her rudder was severely damaged in stormy
seas, making her impossible to steer  The ship's crew had the daunting task of repairing the
rudder at sea, and only succeeded at the second attempt  Cutty Sark reached London a week after
Thermopylae 

" "Reading
Steam ships posed a growing threat to clippers, as their speed and cargo capacity increased  In
addition, the opening of the Suez Canal in , the same year that Cutty Sark was launched,
had a serious impact  While steam ships could make use of the quick, direct route between the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the canal was of no use to sailing ships, which needed the much
stronger winds of the oceans, and so had to sail a far greater distance  Steam ships reduced the
journey time between Britain and China by approximately two months 
By , tea traders weren't interested in Cutty Sark, and instead, she took on the much less
prestigious work of carrying any cargo between any two ports in the world  In , violence
aboard the ship led ultimately to the replacement of the captain with an incompetent drunkard
who stole the crew's wages  He was suspended from service, and a new captain appointed  This,
marked a turnaround and the beginning of the most successful period in Cutty Sark�s working
life, transporting wool from Australia to Britain, One such journey took just under  weeks,
beating every other ship sailing that year by around a month 
The ship�s next captain, Richard Woodget, was an excellent navigator, who got the best out of
both his ship and his crew  As a sailing ship, Cutty Sark depended on the strong trade winds of the
southern hemisphere, and Woodget took her further south than any previous captain, bringing her
dangerously close to icebergs off the southern tip of South America  His gamble paid off, though,
and the ship was the fastest vessel in the wool trade for ten years 
As competition from steam ships increased in the s, and Cutty Sark approached the end of
her life expectancy, she became less profitable, She was sold to a Portuguese firm, which renamed
her Ferreira  For the next  years, she again carried miscellaneous cargoes around the world
Badly damaged in a gale in , she was put into Falmouth harbour in southwest England, for
repairs  Wilfred Dowman, a retired sea captain who owned a training vessel, recognised her and
tried to buy her, but without success  She returned to Portugal and was sold to another Portuguese
company  Dowman was determined, however, and offered a high price: this was accepted, and
the ship returned to Falmouth the following year and had her original name restored 
Dowman used Cutty Sark as a training ship, and she continued in this role after his death  When
she was no longer required, in , she was transferred to dry dock at Greenwich to go on
public display  The ship suffered from fire in , and again, less seriously, in , but now
Cutty Sark attracts a quarter of a million visitors a year

passage  below 

SAVING THE SOIL
More than a third of the Earth's top layer is at risk  Is there hope for our planet's
most precious resource?

A More than a third of the world's soil is endangered, according to a recent UN report 
Ifwe don't slow the decline, all farmable soil could be gone in  years  Since soil
grows % of our food, and sustains human life in other more surprising ways, that
is a huge problem 

B Peter Groffman, from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, points
out that soil scientists have been warning about the degradation of the world�s soil
for decades  At the same time, our understanding of its importance to humans has
grown  A single gram of healthy soil might contain  million bacteria, as well as
other microorganisms such as viruses and fungi, living amid decomposing plants
and various minerals 

That means soils do not just grow our food, but are the source of nearly all our
existing antibiotics, and could be our best hope in the fight against antibiotic-
resistant bacteria  Soil is also an ally against climate change: as microorganisms
within soil digest dead animals and plants, they lock in their carbon content, holding
three times the amount of carbon as does the entire atmosphere  Soils also store
water, preventing flood damage: in the UK, damage to buildings, roads and bridges
from floods caused by soil degradation costs � million every year 

C Ifthe soil loses its ability to perform these functions, the human race could be in

big trouble  The danger is not that the soil will disappear completely, but that the
microorganisms that give it its special properties will be lost  And once this has
happened, it may take the soil thousands of years to recover 

Agriculture is by far the biggest problem  In the wild, when plants grow they remove
nutrients from the soil, but then when the plants die and decay these nutrients are
feturned directly to the soil, Humans tend not to return unused parts of harvested
crops directly to the soil to enrich it, meaning that the soil gradually becomes

less fertile  In the past we developed strategies to get around the problem, such

as regularly varying the types of crops grown, or leaving fields uncultivated for a
season 

D But these practices became inconvenient as populations grew and agriculture had
to be run on more commercial lines  A solution came in the early th century with
the Haber-Bosch process for manufacturing ammonium nitrate  Farmers have been
Putting this synthetic fertiliser on their fields ever since

excess is often washed away with the rain, re �fertilisers hurts the soil itself
recently, we have found that indiscriminate use Oo are eusposed in nourish,
turning it acidic and salty, and degrading the soil they : :
  lution to this problem is Pius Floris, who started

  eT ee ee iaiese tn the Netherlands, and now advises some of the
world�s top soil scientists  He came to realise that the best way to ensure his trees
flourished was to take care of the soil, and has developed a cocktail of beneficial
bacteria, fungi and humus* to do this  Researchers at the University of Valladolid in
Spain recently used this cocktail on soils destroyed by years of fertiliser overuse
When they applied Floris's mix to the desert-like test plots, a good crop of plants
emerged that were not just healthy at the surface, but had roots strong enough to
pierce dirt as hard as rock  The few plants that grew in the control plots, fed with
traditional fertilisers, were small and weak 

F However, measures like this are not enough to solve the global soil degradation
problem  To assess our options on a global scale we first need an accurate picture
of what types of soil are out there, and the problems they face  That's not easy  For
one thing, there is no agreed international system for classifying soil  In an attempt
to unify the different approaches, the UN has created the Global Soil Map project 
Researchers from nine countries are working together to create a map linked to a
database that can be fed measurements from field surveys, drone surveys, satellite
imagery, lab analyses and so on to provide real-time data on the state of the soil 
Within the next four years, they aim to have mapped soils worldwide to a depth of
 metres, with the results freely accessible to all 

G  But this is only a first step  We need ways of presenting the problem that bring
ithome to governments and the wider public, says Pamela Chasek at the
International Institute for Sustainable Development, in Winnipeg, Canada  �Most

Passage  below 
Book Review
The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business
Sold Us Well-Being
By William Davies
�Happiness is the ultimate goal because it is self-evidently good  If we are asked why
happiness matters we can give no further external reason  It just obviously does matter � This
pronouncement by Richard Layard, an economist and advocate of �positive psychology�,
summatises the beliefs of many people today  For Layard and others like him, it is obvious that
the purpose of government is to promote a state of collective well-being  The only question is
how to achieve it, and here positive psychology � a supposed science that not only identifies
what makes people happy but also allows their happiness to be measured � can show the way 
Equipped with this science, they say, governments can secure happiness in society in a way they
never could in the past 
Itis an astonishingly crude and simple-minded way of thinking, and for that very reason
increasingly popular  Those who think in this way are oblivious to the vast philosophical
literature in which the meaning and value of happiness have been explored and questioned,
and write as if nothing of any importance had been thought on the subject until it came to their
attention, It was the philosopher Jeremy Bentham (-) who was more than anyone else
responsible for the development of this way of thinking  For Bentham it was obvious that the
human good consists of pleasure and the absence of pain  The Greek philosopher Aristotle may
have identified happiness with self-realisation in the th century BC, and thinkers throughout the
ages may have struggled to reconcile the pursuit of happiness with other human values, but for
Bentham all this was mere metaphysics or fiction  Without knowing anything much of him or the
school of moral theory he established � since they are by education and intellectual conviction
illiterate in the history of ideas � our advocates of positive psychology follow in his tracks in
rejecting as outmoded and irrelevant pretty much the entirety of ethical reflection on human
happiness to date 
But as William Davies notes in his recent book The Happiness Industry, the view that happiness
is the only self-evident good is actually a way of limiting moral inquiry  One of the virtues of
this rich, lucid and arresting book is that it places the current cult of happiness in a well-defined
historical framework  Rightly, Davies begins his story with Bentham, noting that he was far
more than a philosopher  Davies writes, �Bentham�s activities were those which we might now
associate with a public sector management consultant�, In the s, he wrote to the Home Office
suggesting that the departments of government be linked together through a set of �conversation
tubes�, and to the Bank of England with a design for a printing device that could produce
" "Test 
uunforgenble banknotes, He drew up plans fora *Hrigidarium�  Keep provisions suet  meat,
fish  fruit and vegetables tresh, His celebrated design For at prison � be Known s tt Panoptigans,
in which prisoners woutd be kept in solitary confinement while being visible ul all Uines t the
guns, was very nearly adopted, (Surprisingly� Davies does not discuss the fet that Bentham
meant his Panopticon not just as  miodel prison but also as an instrument oF control that could jy
applied fo schools and factories )
Bentham was also a pioncer of the *selence of happiness�  HE happiness is t be regarded as
aseience, it has to be measured, and Bentham suggested two ways in which this might be
done, Viewing happiness as a complex of pleasurable sensations, he suggested that it might be
quantified by measuring the human pulse rite, Alternatively, money could be used as the standard
for quantification: if two different goods have the same price, it can be claimed that they produce
the same quantity of pleasure in the consumer, Bentham was more attracted by the latter measure,
By associating money so closely to inner experience, Davies writes, Bentham �set the stage for
the entangling of psychological research and capitalism that would shape the business practices
of the tventieth century�,
The Happiness Industry describes how the project of a science of happiness has become
integral to capitalism  We learn much that is interesting about how economic problems are
being redefined and treated as psychological maladies  In addition, Davies shows how the
belief that inner states of pleasure and displeasure can be objectively measured has informed
management studies and advertising  The tendency of thinkers such as J B Watson, the founder
of behaviourism*, was that human beings could be shaped, or manipulated, by policymakers and
managers, Watson had no factual basis for his view of human action, When he became president
of the American Psychological Association in , he *had never even studied a single human
being�: his research had been confined to experiments on white rats  Yet Watson's reductive
model is now widely applied, with �behaviour change� becoming the goal of governments: in
Britain, a �Behaviour Insights Team� has been established by the government to study how people
can be encouraged, ait minimum cost ( the public purse, to live in what are considered to be
socially desirable ways 
Modern industrial societies appear to need the possibility of ever-increasing happiness to
motivate them in their labours, But whatever its intellectual pedigree, the idea that governments
should be responsible for promoting happiness is always a threat to human freedom
