Introdution

Introduction
TO THE STUDENT
About the book
This book has been written for candidates preparing for the revised version
of the International English Language Testing System, known as IELTS.
This is a test designed to assess the English language skills of non-English
speaking students seeking to study in an English speaking country.

Aims of the book
— to prepare you for the test by familiarising you with the types of texts
and tasks that you will meet in the IELTS test, and the level and style of
language used in the test.
— to help you prepare for your studies at university or college
by introducing you to the types of communication tasks which you are
likely to meet in English speaking study environment.

Content of the book
The book contains four complete sample IELTS tests, each comprising
Listening and Speaking modules and Academic Reading and Writing modules.
In addition there is one set of the General Training Reading and Writing
modules. (NB all candidates do the same Listening and Speaking modules.)
To accompany the tests there is an answer key at the back of the book and you
should refer to this after you have attempted each of the practice tests. Also
included is an annotated copy of the listening tapescripts with the appropriate
sections highlighted to help you to check your answers. In addition, you will
find one model answer for each type of writing task to guide you with your
writing. There is a comprehensive key for the Reading and Listening sections,
but if you are in any doubt about your answers, talk to a teacher or an English
speaking friend. Where you are required to answer in your own words, the
answer must be accurate in both meaning as well as grammar in order to be
scored correct.

Benefits of studying for IELTS
By studying for IELTS you will not only be preparing for the test but also
for your future as a student in an English speaking environment. The test
is designed to assess your ability to understand and produce written and
spoken language in an educational context. The book makes reference to
the ways in which university study is organised in many English speaking
countries and the types of academic tasks you will be expected to perform.

1

Introdution

These include:
• Reading and understanding written academic or training language
• Writing assignments in an appropriate style for university study or within a training
context
• Listening to and comprehending spoken language in both lecture format as well as
formal and informal conversational style
• Speaking to colleagues and lecturers on general and given topics in formal and
informal situations

Description of the test
There are two versions of the IELTS test:
Academic Module
for students seeking entry to a university or
institution of higher education offering
degree and diploma courses

General Training Module
for students seeking entry to a secondary
school or to vocational training courses

Note: All candidates must take a test for each of the four skills: listening,
reading, writing and speaking. All candidates take the same Listening and
Speaking modules but may choose between the Academic or General Training
versions of the Reading and Writing sections of the test. You should seek
advice from a teacher or a student adviser if you are in any doubt about
whether to sit for the Academic modules or the General Training modules.
The two do not carry the same weight and are not interchangeable.

How is IELTS scored?
IELTS provides a profile of your ability to use English. In other words your IELTS
result will consist of a score in each of the four skills (listening, reading, writing,
speaking) which is then averaged to give the Overall Band Score or final mark.
Performance is rated in each skill on a scale of 9 to 1. The nine overall Bands and
their descriptive statements are as follows:
9 Expert user
Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate, accurate and fluent
with complete understanding.
8 Very good user
Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional
unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in
unfamiliar situations. Handles complex detailed argumentation well.

7

Introdution
7 Good user
Has operational command of the language, though with occasional inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally
handles complex language well and understands detailed reasoning.
6 Competent user
Has generally effective command of the language despite inaccuracies,
inappropriacies and misunderstandings. Can use and understand fairly complex language, particularly in familiar situations.
5 Modest user
Has partial command of the language, coping with overall meaning in most
situations, though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle
basic communication in own field.
4 Limited user
Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems in
understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language.
3 Extremely limited user
Conveys and understands only general meaning in very familiar situations.
Frequent breakdowns in communication occur.
2 Intermittent user
No real communication is possible except for the most basic information using
isolated words or short formulae in familiar situations and to meet immediate
needs. Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English.
1 Non user
Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated
words.
0 Did not attempt the test
No assessable information provided.

What is the pass mark?
There is no fixed pass mark in IELTS. The institution you want to enter will
decide whether your score is appropriate for the demands of the course of study
or training you want to undertake. However, as a general rule, scores below Band
5 in any one skill are considered too low for academic

8

Introdution
study; scores above Band 6 are deemed to be adequate to good. Overall Band
scores of 5 or 6 are borderline and may not be acceptable at many institutions. If
you are getting only about half of the questions in these sample tests correct, then
you are probably not quite ready to take the IELTS test. Again you should seek
advice from a teacher about your level of English. Remember you must allow a
duration of at least 3 months between each attempt at the test.
For further information about the test, see the IELTS Handbook available from all
test centres and also from UCLES (University of Cambridge Local Examinations
Syndicate), from I DP Education Australia and from British Council Centres.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The tests in this book are similar in length, format and content to the real test, but
success in these tests will not guarantee success in the real test. It often seems
easier to work on practice materials than to sit the tests themselves because you
are not under the same pressure.

Timing
In order to maximise your use of these tests, you should make a note of the time it
takes you to answer each of the sections. As you progress through the book, be
stricter with yourself about the time you allow yourself to complete the sections.

Answer sheets
When you sit for the real IELTS test, you will have answer sheets on which to
write your answers. A sample of these is given at the end of this book. To help you
prepare for the test, we suggest that you write your answers on separate sheets of
paper, rather than in the book itself.

Answer keys
Listening
In addition to the answer key, you will find tapescripts for all of the listening
passages. These have been annotated to show where in the text the answer to each
question can be found. There is very often a signpost word which will cue your
listening. Look out for these signposts. Remember, the answers are usually short
and never more than three words. Read the questions carefully, in the time
provided on the tape, before you listen to each section of the tape.
9

Introdution
Reading
You will meet a number of different question types in the IELTS test. It is a
useful strategy to become familiar with them and learn how best to approach
them. The answer keys at the back of this book not only provide you with the
answer to each question, but also give a suggested approach to each type of
question, so take the time to work through them carefully.

Writing
You will find four sample answers to the writing tasks, one for each task type
on each module. These have been included to give you an idea of the type of
writing expected. However, there will be alternative approaches to each
question and the model answers given should not be seen as prescriptive.
Look carefully at the description of the writing test (given above in the
Introduction) to see exactly which criteria you should be paying attention to in
each task.

Speaking
The sample speaking tasks are to help you prepare for part 3 of the Speaking
test. Remember that the examiner will expect you to show how much English
you know and it is up to you to demonstrate that. You are expected to ask a lot
of questions in part 3 and the examiner will not speak very much and may
even appear to be “unhelpful” at times, to encourage you to ask more
questions. The sample speaking tasks include suggested examiner’s prompts
so that you can see how the interaction might unfold. It may be a useful
preparation strategy to work with a friend and practise the interview format in
this way, using the sample tasks in the book.

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-15 which are based on Reading
Passage 1 below

A spark, a flint: How fire leapt to life
The control of fire
was the first and
perhaps greatest
of humanity’s
steps towards a
life-enhancing
technology
To early man, fire
was a divine gift
randomly delivered
in the form of
lightning, forest
fire or burning lava.
Unable to make
flame
for
themselves, the
earliest peoples
probabh stored fire
by keeping slow burning logs alight or by
carrying charcoal in pots.
How and where man learnt how to produce
flame at will is unknown. It was probably a
secondary invention, accidentally made
during tool-making operations with wood or
stone. Studies of primitive societies suggest
that the earliest method of making fire was
through friction. European peasants would
insert a wooden drill in a round hole and
rotate it briskly between their palms This
process could be speeded up by wrapping a
cord around the drill and pulling on each end.
The Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave
mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays and
burning

20

glasses were also
used by Mexican
Aztecs and the
Chinese.
Percussion
methods of firelighting date back
to Paleolithic times,
when some Stone
Age tool-makers
discovered that
chipping flints
produced sparks.
The
technique
became
more
efficient after the
discovery of iron,
about 5000 vears
ago In Arctic North America, the Eskimos
produced a slow-burning spark by striking
quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that
contains sulphur. The Chinese lit their fires
by striking porcelain with bamboo. In
Europe, the combination of steel, flint and
tinder remained the main method of firelighting until the mid 19th century.
Fire-lighting was revolutionised by the
discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669
by a German alchemist trying to transmute
silver into gold. Impressed by the element’s
combustibility, several 17th century chemists
used it to manufacture fire-lighting devices,
but the results were dangerously
inflammable. With phosphorus costing the

Reading
eqimalent of several hundred pounds per
ounce, the hrst matches were expensive.
The quest for a practical match really began
after 1781 when a group of French chemists
came up with the Phosphoric Candle or
Ethereal Match, a sealed glass tube
containing a twist of paper tipped with
phosphorus. When the tube was broken, air
rushed in, causing the phosphorus to selfcombust. An even more hazardous device,
popular in America, was the Instantaneous
Light Box — a bottle filled with sulphuric
acid into which splints treated with chemicals
were dipped.
The first matches resembling those used
today were made in 1827 by John Walker,
an English pharmacist who borrowed the
formula from a military rocket-maker called
Congreve. Costing a shilling a box,
Congreves were splints coated with sulphur
and tipped with potassium chlorate. To light
them, the user drew them quickly through
folded glass paper.
Walker never patented his invention, and
three years later it was copied by a Samuel
Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers.
About the same time, a French chemistry
student called Charles Sauria produced the
first “strike-anywhere” match by substituting
white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate
in the Walker formula. However, since white
phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845
match-makers exposed to its fumes
succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats
away jaw-bones. It wasn’t until 1906 that the
substance was eventually banned.

That was 62 years after a Swedish chemist
called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red
or amorphous phosphorus, a development
exploited commercially by Pasch’s
compatriot J E Lundstrom in 1885.
Lundstrom’s safety matches were safe
because the red phosphorus was non-toxic;
it was painted on to the striking surface
instead of the match tip, which contained
potassium chlorate with a relatively high
ignition temperature of 182 degrees
centigrade.
America lagged behind Europe in match
technology and safety standards. It wasn’t
until 1900 that the Diamond Match
Company bought a French patent for safety
matches — but the formula did not work
properly in the different climatic conditions
prevailing in America and it was another 11
years before scientists finally adapted the
French patent for the US.
The Americans, however, can claim several
“firsts” in match technology and marketing.
In 1892 the Diamond Match Company
pioneered book matches. The innovation
didn’t catch on until after 1896, when a
brewery had the novel idea of advertising
its product in match books. Today book
matches are the most widely used type in
the US, with 90 percent handed out free by
hotels, restaurants and others.
Other American innovations include an antiafterglow solution to prevent the match from
smouldering after it has been blown out; and
the waterproof match, which lights after
eight hours in water.

Zoo conservation programmes
One of London Zoo’s recent advertisements caused me some irritation, so
patently did it distort reality. Headlined “Without zoos you might as well tell
these animals to get stuffed”, it was bordered with illustrations of several
endangered species and went on to extol the myth that without zoos like
London Zoo these animals “will almost certainly disappear forever”. With
the zoo world’s rather mediocre record on conservation, one might be
forgiven for being slightly sceptical about such an advertisement.
Zoos were originally created as places of entertainment, and their suggested
involvement with conservation didn’t seriously arise until about 30 years
ago, when the Zoological Society of London held the first formal
international meeting on the subject. Eight years later, a series of world
conferences took place, entitled “The Breeding of Endangered Species”, and
from this point onwards conservation became the zoo community’s
buzzword. This commitment has now been clearh defined in The World Zpo
Conservation Strategy (WZGS, September 1993), which although an
important and welcome document does seem to be based on an unrealistic
optimism about the nature of the zoo industry
The WZCS estimates that there are about 10,000 zoos in the world, of which
around 1,000 represent a core of quality collections capable of participating
in co-ordinated conservation programmes. This is probably the document’s
first failing, as I believe that 10,000 is a serious underestimate of the total
number of places masquerading as zoological establishments. Of course it is
difficult to get accurate data but, to put the issue into perspective, I have
found that, in a year of working in Eastern Europe, I discover fresh zoos on
almost a weekly basis.
The second flaw in the reasoning of the WZCS document is the naive faith it
places in its 1,000 core zoos. One would assume that the calibre of these
institutions would have been carefully examined, but it appears that the criterion
for inclusion on this select list might merely be that the zoo is a member of a
zoo federation or association. This might be a good starting point, working on
the premise that members must meet certain standards, but again the facts don’t
support the theory. The greatly respected American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) has had extremely dubious members, and in
the UK the Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland has

24

Reading
occasionally had members that have been roundly censured in the national press.
These include Robin Hill Adventure Park on the Isle of Wight, which many
considered the most notorious collection of animals in the country. This
establishment, which for years was protected by the Isle’s local council (which
viewed it as a tourist amenity), was finally closed down following a damning
report by a veterinary inspector appointed under the terms of the Zoo Licensing
Act 1981. As it was always a collection of dubious repute, one is obliged to
reflect upon the standards that the Zoo Federation sets when granting
membership. The situation is even worse in developing countries where little
money is available for redevelopment and it is hard to see a way of incorporating
collections into the overall scheme of the WZCS.
Even assuming that the WZCS’s 1,000 core zoos are all of a high standard
complete with scientific staff and research facilities, trained and dedicated
keepers, accommodation that permits normal or natural behaviour, and a policy
of co-operating fully with one another what might be the potential for
conservation? Colin Tudge, author of Last Animals at the Zoo (Oxford University
Press, 1992), argues that “if the world”s zoos worked together in co-operative
breeding programmes, then even without further expansion they could save
around 2,000 species of endangered land vertebrates’. This seems an extremely
optimistic proposition from a man who must be aware of the failings and
weaknesses of the zoo industry the man who, when a member of the council of
London Zoo, had to persuade the zoo to devote more of its activities to
conservation. Moreover, where are the facts to support such optimism?
Today approximately 16 species might be said to have been “saved” by captive
breeding programmes, although a number of these can hardly be looked upon
as resounding successes. Beyond that, about a further 20 species are being
seriously considered for zoo conservation programmes. Given that the
international conference at London Zoo was held 30 years ago, this is pretty
slow progress, and a long way off Tudge’s target of 2,000.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 29-40 which are based on Reading Passage
3 below.

ARCHITECTURE - Reaching for the Sky
Architecture is the art and
science of designing buildings
and structures. A building
reflects the scientific and
technological achievements
of the age as well as the ideas
and aspirations of the
designer and client. The
appearance of individual
buildings, however, is often
controversial.
The use of an architectural
style cannot be said to start or
finish on a specific date.
Neither is it possible to say
exactly what characterises a
particular movement. But the
origins of what is now
generally known as modern
architecture can be traced
back to the social and
technological changes of the
18th and 19th centuries.
Instead of using timber,
stone and traditional building
techniques, architects began
to explore ways of creating
buildings by using the latest
technology and materials
such as steel, glass and
concrete strengthened steel
bars, known as reinforced
concrete. Technological
advances also helped bring
about the decline of rural
industries and an increase in
urban populations as people
moved to the towns to work in
the new factories. Such rapid
and uncontrolled growth
helped to turn parts of cities
into slums.
By the 1920s architects
throughout Europe were
reacting against the

28

conditions created by
industrialisation. A new style of
architecture emerged to reflect
more idealistic notions for the
future. It was made possible by
new materials and construction
techniques and was known as
Modernism.
By the 1930s many buildings
emerging from this movement
were designed in the
International Style. This was
largely characterised by the bold
use of new materials and simple,
geometric forms, often with
white walls supported by stiltlike pillars. These were stripped
of unnecessary decoration that
would detract from their primary
purpose — to be used or lived in.
Walter Gropius, Charles
Jeanneret (better known as Le
Corbusier) and Ludwig Mies van
der Rohe were among the most
influential of the many architects
who contributed to the
development of Modernism in
the first half of the century. But
the economic depression of the
1930s and the second world war
(1939-45) prevented their ideas
from being widely realised until
the economic conditions
improved and war-torn cities
had to be rebuilt. By the 1950s,
the International Style had
developed into a universal
approach to building, which
standardised the appearance of
new buildings in cities across the
world.
Unfortunately, this Modernist
interest in geometric simplicity
and function became exploited
for profit. The rediscovery of

quick-and-easy-to-handle
reinforced concrete and an
improved ability to
prefabricate building sections
meant that builders could
meet the budgets of
commissioning authorities
and handle a renewed
demand for development
quickly and cheaply. But this
led to many badly designed
buildings, which discredited
the original aims of
Modernism.
Influenced by Le
Corbusier’s ideas on town
planning, every large British
city built multi-storey housing
estates in the 1960s. Massproduced, low-cost high-rises
seemed to offer a solution to
the problem of housing a
growing inner-city population.
But far from meeting human
needs, the new estates often
proved to be windswept
deserts lacking essential
social facilities and services.
Many of these buildings were
poorly designed and
constructed and have since
been demolished.
By the 1970s, a new respect
for the place of buildings
within the existing townscape
arose. Preserving historic
buildings or keeping only their
facades (or fronts) grew
common. Architects also
began to make more use of
building styles and materials
that were traditional to the
area. The architectural style
usually referred to as High
Tech was also emerging. It

Reading
celebrated scientific and
engineering achievements by
openly parading the
sophisticated techniques
used in construction. Such
buildings are commonly
made of metal and glass;
examples are Stansted
airport and the Lloyd’s
building in London.
Disillusionment at the
failure of many of the poor
imitations of Modernist
architecture led to interest in
various styles and ideas from
the past and present. By the
1980s the coexistence of

different styles of architecture in
the same building became
known as Post Modern. Other
architects looked back to the
classical tradition. The trend in
architecture now favours smaller
scale building design that
reflects a growing public
awareness of environmental
issues such as energy
efficiency. Like the Modernists,
people today recognise that a
well designed environment
improves the quality of life but is
not necessarily achieved by
adopting one well defined style
of architecture.

Twentieth century
architecture will mainly be
remembered for its tall
buildings. They have been
made possible by the
development of light steel
frames and safe passenger
lifts. They originated in the US
over a century ago to help
meet the demand for more
economical use of land. As
construction techniques
improved, the skyscraper
became a reality.

READING
READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-12 which are based on Reading Passage 1
below.

Right and left-handedness in humans
Why do humans, virtually alone among all
animal species, display a distinct left or
right-handedness? Not even our closest
relatives among the apes possess such
decided lateral asymmetry, as psychologists
call it. Yet about 90 per cent of every human
population that has ever lived appears to
have been right-handed. Professor Bryan
Turner at Deakin University has studied the
research literature on left-handedness and
found that handedness goes with sidedness.
So nine out of ten people are right-handed
and eight are right-footed. He noted that this
distinctive asymmetry in the human
population is itself systematic. “Humans
think in categories: black and white, up and
down, left and right. It”s a system of signs
that enables us to categorise phenomena that
are essentially ambiguous.’
Research has shown that there is a genetic
or inherited element to handedness. But
while left-handedness tends to run in
families, neither left nor right handers will
automatically produce off-spring with the
same handedness; in fact about 6 per cent
of children with two right-handed parents
will be left-handed. However, among two
left-handed parents, perhaps 40 per cent of
the children will also be left-handed. With
one right and one left-handed parent, 15 to
20 per cent of the offspring will be left-

40

handed. Even among identical twins who
have exactly the same genes, one in six pairs
will differ in their handedness.
What then makes people left-handed if it is
not simply genetic? Other factors must be
at work and researchers have turned to the
brain for clues. In the 1860s the French
surgeon and anthropologist, Dr Paul Broca,
made the remarkable finding that patients
who had lost their powers of speech as a
result of a stroke (a blood clot in the brain)
had paralysis of the right half of their body.
He noted that since the left hemisphere of
the brain controls the right half of the body,
and vice versa, the brain damage must have
been in the brain’s left hemisphere.
Psychologists now believe that among
right-handed people, probably 95 per cent
have their language centre in the left
hemisphere, while 5 per cent have rightsided language. Left-handers, however, do
not show the reverse pattern but instead a
majority also have their language in the left
hemisphere. Some 30 per cent have right
hemisphere language.
Dr Brinkman, a brain researcher at the
Australian National University in Canberra,
has suggested that evolution of speech went
with right-handed preference. According to
Brinkman, as the brain evolved, one side

Reading

became specialised for fine control of
movement (necessary for producing speech)
and along with this evolution came righthand preference. According to Brinkman,
most left-handers have left hemisphere
dominance but also some capacity in the
right hemisphere. She has observed that if a
left-handed person is brain-damaged in the
left hemisphere, the recovery of speech is
quite often better and this is explained by
the fact that left-handers have a more
bilateral speech function.
In her studies of macaque monkeys,
Brinkman has noticed that primates
(monkeys) seem to learn a hand preference
from their mother in the first year of life but
this could be one hand or the other. In
humans, however, the specialisation in
(unction of the two hemispheres results in
anatomical differences: areas that are
involved with the production of speech are
usually larger on the left side than on the
right. Since monkeys have not acquired the
art of speech, one would not expect to see
such a variation but Brinkman claims to have
discovered a trend in monkeys towards the
asymmetry that is evident in the human
brain.
Two American researchers, Geschwind and
Galaburda, studied the brains of human
embryos and discovered that the left-right
asymmetry exists before birth. But as the
brain develops, a number of things can affect
it. Every brain is initially female in its
organisation and it only becomes a male
brain when the male foetus begins to secrete
hormones. Geschwind and Galaburda knew
that different parts of the brain mature at
different rates; the right hemisphere
develops first, then the left. Moreover, a
girl’s brain develops somewhat faster than

that of a boy. So, if something happens to
the brain’s development during pregnancy,
it is more likely to be affected in a male
and the hemisphere more likely to be
involved is the left. The brain may become
less lateralised and this in turn could result
in left-handedness and the development of
certain superior skills that have their origins
in the left hemisphere such as logic,
rationality and abstraction. It should be no
surprise then that among mathematicians
and architects, left-handers tend to be more
common and there are more left-handed
males than females.
The results of this research may be some
consolation to left-handers who have for
centuries lived in a world designed to suit
right-handed people. However, what is
alarming, according to Mr. Charles Moore,
a writer and journalist, is the way the word
“right” reinforces its own virtue.
Subliminally he says, language tells people
to think that anything on the right can be
trusted while anything on the left is
dangerous or even sinister. We speak of lefthanded compliments and according to
Moore, “it is no coincidence that lefthanded children, forced to use their right
hand, often develop a stammer as they are
robbed of their freedom of speech”.
However, as more research is undertaken
on the causes of left-handedness, attitudes
towards left-handed people are gradually
changing for the better. Indeed when the
champion tennis player Ivan Lendl was
asked what the single thing was that he
would choose in order to improve his game,
he said he would like to become a lefthander.

2 below.

MIGRATORY BEEKEEPING

Taking Wing
To eke out a full-time living from their
honeybees, about half the nation’s 2,000
commercial beekeepers pull up stakes
each spring, migrating north to find more
flowers for their bees. Besides turning
floral nectar into honey, these
hardworking insects also pollinate crops
for farmers -for a fee. As autumn
approaches, the beekeepers pack up their
hives and go south, scrambling for
pollination contracts in hot spots like
California’s fertile Central Valley.
Of the 2,000 commercial beekeepers in the
United States about half migrate This pays
off in two ways Moving north in the summer
and south in the winter lets bees work a longer
blooming season, making more honey — and
44

money — for their keepers. Second,
beekeepers can carry their hives to farmers
who need bees to pollinate their crops. Every
spring a migratory beekeeper in California
may move up to 160 million bees to

Rreading
flowering fields in Minnesota and every
winter his family may haul the hives back to
California, where farmers will rent the bees
to pollinate almond and cherry trees.
Migratory beekeeping is nothing new. The
ancient Egyptians moved clay hives,
probably on rafts, down the Nile to follow
the bloom and nectar flow as it moved toward
Cairo. In the 1880s North American
beekeepers experimented with the same idea,
moving bees on barges along the Mississippi
and on waterways in Florida, but their lighter,
wooden hives kept falling into the water.
Other keepers tried the railroad and horsedrawn wagons, but that didn’t prove practical.
Not until the 1920s when cars and trucks
became affordable and roads improved, did
migratory beekeeping begin to catch on.
For the Californian beekeeper, the pollination
season begins in February. At this time, the
beehives are in particular demand by farmers
who have almond groves; they need two
hives an acre. For the three-week long bloom,
beekeepers can hire out their hives for $32
each. It’s a bonanza for the bees too. Most
people consider almond honey too bitter to
eat so the bees get to keep it for themselves.
By early March it is time to move the bees.
It can take up to seven nights to pack the
4,000 or so hives that a beekeeper may own.
These are not moved in the middle of the day
because too many of the bees would end up
homeless. But at night, the hives are stacked
onto wooden pallets, back-to-back in sets of
four, and lifted onto a truck. It is not necessary
to wear gloves or a beekeeper’s veil because
the hives are not being opened and the bees
should remain relatively quiet. Just in case
some are still lively, bees can be pacified with
a few puffs of smoke blown into each hive’s
narrow entrance.
In their new location, the beekeeper will pay
the farmer to allow his bees to feed in such
places as orange groves. The honey produced
here is fragrant and sweet and can be sold by
the beekeepers. To encourage the bees to

produce as much honey as possible during
this period, the beekeepers open the hives
and stack extra boxes called supers on top.
These temporary hive extensions contain
frames of empty comb for the bees to fill
with honey. In the brood chamber below, the
bees will stash honey to eat later. To prevent
the queen from crawling up to the top and
laying eggs, a screen can be inserted
between the brood chamber and the supers.
Three weeks later the honey can be gathered.
Foul smelling chemicals are often used to
irritate the bees and drive them down into
the hive’s bottom boxes, leaving the honeyfilled supers more or less bee free. These
can then be pulled off the hive. They are
heavy with honey and may weigh up to 90
pounds each. The supers are taken to a
warehouse. In the extracting room, the
frames are lilted out and lowered into an
“uncapper” where rotating blades shave
away the wax that covers each cell. The
uncapped frames are put in a carousel that
sits on the bottom of a large stainless steel
drum. The carousel is filled to capacity with
72 frames. A switch is flipped and the frames
begin to whirl at 300 revolutions per minute;
centrifugal force throws the honey out of
the combs. Finally the honey is poured into
barrels for shipment.
After this, approximately a quarter of the
hives weakened by disease, mites, or an
ageing or dead queen, will have to be
replaced. To create new colonies, a healthy
double hive, teeming with bees, can be
separated into two boxes. One half will hold
the queen and a young, already mated queen
can be put in the other half, to make two
hives from one. By the time the flowers
bloom, the new queens will be laying eggs,
filling each hive with young worker bees.
The beekeeper’s family will then migrate
with them to their summer location.
Adapted from “America's Beekeepers:
Hives for Hire” by Alan Mairson,
National Geographic.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 28-41 which are based on Reading Passage
3 below.

TOURISM
A Tourism, holidaymaking and travel are these
days more significant social phenomena
than most commentators have considered
On the face of it there could not be a more
trivial subject for a book And indeed since
social scientists have had considerable
difficulty explaining weightier topics such as
work or politics it might be thought that they
would have great difficulties in accounting
for more trivial phenomena such as
holidaymakmg However there are
interesting parallels with the study of
deviance This involves the investigation of
bizarre and idiosyncratic social practices
which happen to be defined as deviant in
some societies but not necessarily in others
The assumption is that the investigation of
deviance can reveal interesting and
significant aspects of normal societies It
could be said that a similar analysis can be
applied to tourism
B Tourism is a leisure activity which
presupposes its opposite namely regulated
and organised work It is one manifestation
of how work and leisure are organised as
separate and regulated spheres of social
practice in modern societies Indeed acting
as a tourist is one of the defining
characteristics of being modern’ and the
popular concept of tourism is that it is
organised within particular places and
occurs for regularised periods of time Tourist
relationships arise from a movement of
people to and their stay in various
destinations This necessarily involves some
movement that is the journey and a period
of stay in a new place or places The journey
and the stay are by definition outside the
normal places of residence and work and
are of a short term and temporary nature
and there is a clear intention to return
“home within a relatively short period of time
C A substantial proportion of the population of
modern societies engages in such tourist

48

practices new socialised forms of provision
have developed in order to cope with the
mass character of the gazes of tourists as
opposed to the individual character of
travel Places are chosen to be visited and
be gazed upon because there is an
anticipation especially through
daydreaming and fantasy of intense
pleasures, either on a different scale or
involving different senses from those
customarily encountered Such anticipation
is constructed and sustained through a
variety of non-tourist practices such as
films TV literature, magazines records and
videos which construct and reinforce this
daydreaming
D Tourists tend to visit features of landscape
and townscape which separate them off
from everyday experience Such aspects
are viewed because they are taken to be in
some sense out of the ordinary The
viewing of these tourist sights often
involves different forms of social patterning
with a much greater sensitivity to visual
elements of landscape or townscape than
is normally found in everyday life People
linger over these sights in a way that they
would not normally do in their home
environment and the vision is objectified or
captured through photographs postcards
films and so on which enable the memory
to be endlessly reproduced and recaptured
E One of the earliest dissertations on the
subject of tourism is Boorstins analysis of
the pseudo event (1964) where he argues
that contemporary Americans cannot
experience reality’ directly but thrive on
“pseudo events Isolated from the host
environment and the local people the
mass tourist travels in guided groups and
finds pleasure in inauthentic contrived
attractions gullibly enjoying the pseudo
events and disregarding the real world
outside Over time the images generated
of different tourist sights come to
constitute a closed self-perpetuating
system of illusions which provide the
tourist with the basis for selecting and

Reading
evaluating potential places to visit Such
visits are made says Boorstin, within the
“environmental bubble of the familiar
American style hotel which insulates the
tourist from the strangeness of the host
environment
F To service the burgeoning tourist industry,
an array of professionals has developed
who attempt to reproduce ever-new objects
for the tourist to look at These objects or
places are located in a complex and
changing hierarchy This depends upon the
interplay between, on the one hand,
competition between interests involved in

the provision of such objects and, on the
other hand changing class, gender, and
generational distinctions of taste within the
potential population of visitors It has been
said that to be a tourist is one of the
characteristics of the “modern experience
Not to go away is like not possessing a car
or a nice house Travel is a marker of status
in modern societies and is also thought to
be necessary for good health The role of
the professional, therefore, is to cater for
the needs and tastes of the tourists in
accordance with their class and overall
expectations

READING PASSAGE 1

Passage 2 below.

SPOKEN CORPUS COMES TO LIFE
A The compiling of dictionaries has been historically the provenance
of studious professorial types - usually bespectacled - who love
to pore over weighty tomes and make pronouncements on the
finer nuances of meaning. They were probably good at crosswords
and definitely knew a lot of words, but the image was always
rather dry and dusty. The latest technology, and simple technology
at that, is revolutionising the content of dictionaries and the way
they are put together.
B For the first time, dictionary publishers are incorporating real,
spoken English into their data. It gives lexicographers (people
who write dictionaries) access to a more vibrant, up-to-date
vernacular language which has never really been studied before.
In one project, 150 volunteers each agreed to discreetly tie a
Walkman recorder to their waist and leave it running for anything
up to two weeks. Every conversation they had was recorded. When
the data was collected, the length of tapes was 35 times the depth
of the Atlantic Ocean. Teams of audio typists transcribed the tapes
to produce a computerised database of ten million words.
C This has been the basis - along with an existing written corpus for the Language Activator dictionary, described by lexicographer
Professor Randolph Quirk as “the book the world has been waiting
for”. It shows advanced foreign learners of English how the
language is really used. In the dictionary, key words such as “eat”
are followed by related phrases such as “wolf down” or “be a
picky eater”, allowing the student to choose the appropriate phrase.
D “This kind of research would be impossible without computers,”
said Delia Summers, a director of dictionaries. “It has transformed
the way lexicographers work. If you look at the word “like”, you
may intuitively think that the first and most frequent meaning is
the verb, as in “I like swimming”. It is not. It is the preposition, as
in: “she walked like a duck”. Just because a word or phrase is

60

Reading

used doesn’t mean it ends up in a dictionary. The sifting out process
is as vital as ever. But the database does allow lexicographers to
search for a word and find out how frequently it is used - something
that could only be guessed at intuitively before.
E Researchers have found that written English works in a very
different way to spoken English. The phrase “say what you like”
literally means “feel free to say anything you want”, but in reality
it is used, evidence shows, by someone to prevent the other person
voicing disagreement. The phrase “it”s a question of crops up on
the database over and over again. It has nothing to do with enquiry,
but it’s one of the most frequent English phrases which has never
been in a language learner’s dictionary before: it is now.
F The Spoken Corpus computer shows how inventive and humorous
people are when they are using language by twisting familiar
phrases for effect. It also reveals the power of the pauses and
noises we use to play for time, convey emotion, doubt and irony.
G For the moment, those benefiting most from the Spoken Corpus
are foreign learners. “Computers allow lexicographers to search
quickly through more examples of real English,” said Professor
Geoffrey Leech of Lancaster University. “They allow dictionaries
to be more accurate and give a feel for how language is being
used.” The Spoken Corpus is part of the larger British National
Corpus, an initiative carried out by several groups involved in the
production of language learning materials: publishers, universities
and the British Library.

Passage 2 below.

Moles happy as homes go underground
A The first anybody knew about Dutchman
Frank Siegmund and his family was
when workmen tramping through a field
found a narrow steel chimney protruding
through the grass. Closer inspection
revealed a chink of sky-light window
among the thistles, and when amazed
investigators moved down the side of the
hill they came across a pine door
complete with leaded diamond glass and
a brass knocker set into an underground
building. The Siegmunds had managed
to live undetected for six years outside
the border town of Breda, in Holland.
They are the latest in a clutch of
individualistic homemakers who have
burrowed underground in search of
tranquillity.
B Most, falling foul of strict building
regulations, have been forced to
dismantle their individualistic homes and
return to more conventional lifestyles.
But subterranean suburbia, Dutch-style,
is about to become respectable and
chic. Seven luxury homes cosseted
away inside a high earth-covered noise
embankment next to the main Tilburg
city road recently went on the market for
$296,500 each. The foundations had yet
to be dug, but customers queued up to
buy the unusual part-submerged
houses, whose back wall consists of a
grassy mound and whose front is a long
glass gallery.
C The Dutch are not the only would-be

64

moles. Growing numbers of Europeans
are burrowing below ground to create
houses, offices, discos and shopping
malls. It is already proving a way of life in
extreme climates; in winter months in
Montreal, Canada, for instance, citizens
can escape the cold in an underground
complex complete with shops and even
health clinics. In Tokyo builders are
planning a massive underground city to
be begun in the next decade, and
underground shopping malls are already
common in Japan, where 90 percent of
the population is squeezed into 20
percent of the landspace.
D Building big commercial buildings
underground can be a way to avoid
disfiguring or threatening a beautiful or
“environmentally sensitive” landscape.
Indeed many of the buildings which
consume most land -such as cinemas,
supermarkets, theatres, warehouses or
libraries -have no need to be on the
surface since they do not need windows.
E There are big advantages, too, when it
comes to private homes. A development
of 194 houses which would take up 14
hectares of land above ground would
occupy 2.7 hectares below it, while the
number of roads would be halved. Under
several metres of earth, noise is minimal
and insulation is excellent. “We get 40 to
50 enquiries a week,” says Peter
Carpenter, secretary of the British Earth
Sheltering Association, which builds

Reading

similar homes in Britain. "People see this
as a way of building for the future." An
underground dweller himself, Carpenter
has never paid a heating bill, thanks to
solar panels and natural insulation.
F In Europe the obstacle has been
conservative local authorities and
developers who prefer to ensure quick
sales with conventional mass produced
housing. But the Dutch development was
greeted with undisguised relief by South
Limburg planners because of Holland's
chronic shortage of land. It was the
Tilburg architect Jo Hurkmans who hit on
the idea of making use of noise
embankments on main roads. His twofloored, four-bedroomed, twobathroomed detached homes are now
taking shape. "They are not so much
below the earth as in it," he says. "All the
light will come through the glass front,
which runs from the second floor ceiling
to the ground. Areas which do not need
much natural lighting are at the back. The
living accommodation is to the front so
nobody notices that the back is dark."
G In the US, where energy-efficient homes
became popular after the oil crisis of
1973, 10,000 underground houses have
been built. A terrace of five homes,
Britain's first subterranean development,
is under way in Nottinghamshire. Italy's
outstanding example of subterranean
architecture is the Olivetti residential
centre in Ivrea. Commissioned by

Roberto Olivetti in 1969, it comprises
82 one-bedroomed apartments and
12 maisonettes and forms a house/
hotel for Olivetti employees. It is built
into a hill and little can be seen from
outside except a glass facade. Patnzia
Vallecchi, a resident since 1992, says
it is little different from living in a
conventional apartment.
H Not everyone adapts so well, and in
Japan scientists at the Shimizu
Corporation have developed "space
creation" systems which mix light,
sounds, breezes and scents to
stimulate people who spend long
periods below ground. Underground
offices in Japan are being equipped
with "virtual" windows and mirrors,
while underground departments in the
University of Minnesota have
periscopes to reflect views and light.
I But Frank Siegmund and his family love
their hobbit lifestyle. Their home
evolved when he dug a cool room for
his bakery business in a hill he had
created. During a heatwave they took
to sleeping there. "We felt at peace
and so close to nature," he says.
"Gradually I began adding to the
rooms. It sounds strange but we are
so close to the earth we draw strength
from its vibrations. Our children love it;
not every child can boast of being
watched through their playroom
windows by rabbits.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-38 which are based on Reading Passage
3 below.

A Workaholic Economy
FOR THE first century or so of the
industrial
revolution,
increased
productivity led to decreases in working
hours. Employees who had been putting
in 12-hour days, six days a week, found
their time on the job shrinking to 10 hours
daily, then, finally, to eight hours, five
days a week. Only a generation ago social
planners worried about what people
would do with all this new-found free
time. In the US, at least, it seems they
need not have bothered.
Although the output per hour of work has
more than doubled since 1945, leisure
seems reserved largely for the
unemployed and underemployed. Those
who work full-time spend as much time
on the job as they did at the end of World
War II. In fact, working hours have
increased noticeably since 1970 —
perhaps because real wages have
stagnated since that year. Bookstores now
abound with manuals describing how to
manage time and cope with stress.
There are several reasons for lost leisure.
Since 1979, companies have responded
to improvements in the business climate
by having employees work overtime
rather than by hiring extra personnel, says
economist Juliet B. Schor of Harvard
University. Indeed, the current economic
recovery has gained a certain amount of
notoriety for its “jobless” nature:

increased production has been almost
entirel} decoupled from employment.
Some firms are even downsizing as their
profits climb. “All things being equal,
we”d be better off spreading around the
work,’ observes labour economist
Ronald G. Ehrenberg of Cornell
University.
Yet a host of factors pushes employers
to hire fewer workers for more hours
and, at the same time, compels workers
to spend more time on the job. Most of
those incentives involve what Ehrenberg
calls the structure of compensation:
quirks in the way salaries and benefits
are organised that make it more
profitable to ask 40 employees to labour
an extra hour each than to hire one more
worker to do the same 40-hour job.
Professional and managerial employees
supply the most obvious lesson along
these lines. Once people are on salary,
their cost to a firm is the same whether
they spend 35 hours a week in the office
or 70. Diminishing returns may
eventually set in as overworked
employees lose efficiency or leave for
more arable pastures. But in the short
run, the employer’s incentive is clear.
Even hourly employees receive benefits such as pension contributions and medical
insurance - that are not tied to the number
of hours they work. Therefore, it is more

Writing

profitable for employers to work their
existing employees harder.
For all that employees complain about
long hours, they, too, have reasons not
to trade money for leisure. “People who
work reduced hours pay a huge penalty
in career terms,” Schor maintains. “It”s
taken as a negative signal’ about their
commitment to the firm.’ [Lotte] Bailyn
[of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology] adds that many corporate
managers find it difficult to measure the
contribution of their underlings to a
firm’s well-being, so they use the number
of hours worked as a proxy for output.
“Employees know this,” she says, and
they adjust their behavior accordingly.
“Although the image of the good worker
is the one whose life belongs to the
company,” Bailyn says, “it doesn”t fit the
facts.’ She cites both quantitative and
qualitative studies that show increased
productivity for part-time workers: they
make better use of the time they have, and
they are less likely to succumb to fatigue in
stressful jobs. Companies that employ more
workers for less time also gain from the
resulting redundancy, she asserts. “The extra
people can cover the contingencies that you

know are going to happen, such as when

crises take people away from the
workplace.’ Positive experiences with
reduced hours have begun to change the
more-is-better culture at some
companies, Schor reports.
Larger firms, in particular, appear to be
more willing to experiment with flexible
working arrangements...
It may take even more than changes in
the financial and cultural structures of
employment for workers successfully to
trade increased productivity and money
for leisure time, Schor contends. She
says the U.S. market for goods has
become skewed by the assumption of
full-time, two-career households.
Automobile makers no longer
manufacture cheap models, and
developers do not build the tiny
bungalows that served the first postwar
generation of home buyers. Not even the
humblest household object is made
without a microprocessor. As Schor
notes, the situation is a curious inversion
of the “appropriate technology” vision
that designers have had for developing
countries: U.S. goods are appropriate
only for high incomes and long hours.

GLASS

CAPTURING THE DANCE
OF LIGHT
A Glass, in one form or another, has long been in noble
service to humans As one of the most widely used
of manufactured materials, and certainly the most
versatile, it can be as imposing as a telescope mirror
the width of a tennis court or as small and simple as
a marble rolling across dirt The uses of this
adaptable material have been broadened
dramatically by new technologies glass fibre
optics — more than eight million miles —
carrying telephone and television signals
across nations, glass ceramics serving as the
nose cones of missiles and as crowns for
teeth; tiny glass beads taking radiation doses
inside the body to specific organs, even a new
type of glass fashioned of nuclear waste in
order to dispose of that unwanted material.
B On the horizon are optical computers These
could store programs and process
information by means of light - pulses from
tiny lasers - rather than electrons And the
pulses would travel over glass fibres, not
copper wire These machines could function
hundreds of times faster than today’s
electronic computers and hold vastly more
information Today fibre optics are used
to obtain a clearer image of smaller and
smaller objects than ever before - even bacterial
80

Reading
viruses. A new generation of optical
instruments is emerging that can provide
detailed imaging of the inner workings
of cells. It is the surge in fibre optic use
and in liquid crystal displays that has set
the U.S. glass industry (a 16 billion dollar
business employing some 150,000
workers) to building new plants to meet
demand.
C But it is not only in technology and
commerce that glass has widened its
horizons. The use of glass as art, a
tradition spins back at least to Roman
times, is also booming. Nearly
everywhere, it seems, men and women
are blowing glass and creating works of
art. «I didn’t sell a piece of glass until
1975,» Dale Chihuly said, smiling, for
in the 18 years since the end of the dry
spell, he has become one of the most
financially successful artists of the 20th
century. He now has a new commission
- a glass sculpture for the headquarters
building of a pizza company - for which
his fee is half a million dollars.
D But not all the glass technology that
touches our lives is ultra-modern.
Consider the simple light bulb; at the turn
of the century most light bulbs were hand
blown, and the cost of one was equivalent
to half a day’s pay for the average worker.
In effect, the invention of the ribbon
machine by Corning in the 1920s lighted
a nation. The price of a bulb plunged.
Small wonder that the machine has been
called one of the great mechanical
achievements of all time. Yet it is very
simple: a narrow ribbon of molten glass
travels over a moving belt of steel in
which there are holes. The glass sags
through the holes and into waiting
moulds. Puffs of compressed air then

shape the glass. In this way, the envelope
of a light bulb is made by a single
machine at the rate of 66,000 an hour, as
compared with 1,200 a day produced by
a team of four glassblowers.
E The secret of the versatility of glass lies
in its interior structure. Although it is
rigid, and thus like a solid, the atoms are
arranged in a random disordered fashion,
characteristic of a liquid. In the melting
process, the atoms in the raw materials
are disturbed from their normal position
in the molecular structure; before they
can find their way back to crystalline
arrangements the glass cools. This
looseness in molecular structure gives
the material what engineers call
tremendous “formability” which allows
technicians to tailor glass to whatever
they need.
F Today, scientists continue to experiment
with new glass mixtures and building
designers test their imaginations with
applications of special types of glass. A
London architect, Mike Davies, sees
even more dramatic buildings using
molecular chemistry. “Glass is the great
building material of the future, the
«dynamic skin»,’ he said. “Think of glass
that has been treated to react to electric
currents going through it, glass that will
change from clear to opaque at the push
of a button, that gives you instant
curtains. Think of how the tall buildings
in New York could perform a symphony
of colours as the glass in them is made
to change colours instantly.” Glass as
instant curtains is available now, but the
cost is exorbitant. As for the glass
changing colours instantly, that may
come true. Mike Davies’s vision may
indeed be on the way to fulfilment.

Passage 2 below

Why some women cross
the finish line ahead of men

RECRUITMENT
The course is tougher but women are
staying the distance, reports Andrew
Crisp.

A Women who apply for jobs in middle or
senior management have a higher success
rate than men, according to an
employment survey. But of course far
fewer of them apply for these positions.
The study, by recruitment consultants NB

84

Selection, shows that while one in six
men who appear on interview shortlists
get jobs, the figure rises to one in four
for women.
B The study concentrated on applications
for management positions in the $45,000
to $110,000 salary range and found that
women are more successful than men in
both the private and public sectors Dr
Elisabeth Marx from London-based NB
Selection described the findings as

Rreading
encouraging for women, in that they send
a positive message to them to apply for
interesting management positions. But
she added, “We should not lose sight of
the fact that significantly fewer women
apply for senior positions in comparison
with men.”
C Reasons for higher success rates among
women are difficult to isolate. One
explanation suggested is that if a woman
candidate manages to get on a shortlist,
then she has probably already proved
herself to be an exceptional candidate.
Dr Marx said that when women apply
for positions they tend to be better
qualified than their male counterparts but
are more selective and conservative in
their job search. Women tend to research
thoroughly before applying for positions
or attending interviews. Men, on the
other hand, seem to rely on their ability
to sell themselves and to convince
employers that any shortcomings they
have will not prevent them from doing a
good job.
D Managerial and executive progress made
by women is confirmed by the annual
survey of boards of directors carried out
by
Korn/Ferry/Carre/
Orban
International. This year the survey shows
a doubling of the number of women
serving as non-executive directors
compared with the previous year.
However, progress remains painfully
slow and there were still only 18 posts
filled by women out of a total of 354 nonexecutive positions surveyed. Hilary
Sears, a partner with Korn/Ferry, said,
“Women have raised the level of grades
we are employed in but we have still not
broken through barriers to the top.”

E In Europe a recent feature of corporate
life in the recession has been the delayering of management structures.
Sears said that this has halted progress
for women in as much as de-layering has
taken place either where women are
working or in layers they aspire to. Sears
also noted a positive trend from the
recession, which has been the growing
number of women who have started up
on their own.
F

In business as a whole, there are a
number of factors encouraging the
prospect of greater equality in the
workforce. Demographic trends suggest
that the number of women going into
employment is steadily increasing. In
addition a far greater number of women
are now passing through higher
education, making them better qualified
to move into management positions.

G Organisations such as the European
Women’s Management Development
Network provide a range of
opportunities for women to enhance
their skills and contacts. Through a series
of both pan-European and national
workshops and conferences the barriers
to women in employment are being
broken down. However, Ariane Berthoin
Antal, director of the International
Institute for Organisational Change of
Archamps in France, said that there is
only anecdotal evidence of changes in
recruitment patterns. And she said, “It”s
still so hard for women to even get on to
shortlists -there are so many hurdles and
barriers.’ Antal agreed that there have
been some positive signs but said “Until
there is a belief among employers, until
they value the difference, nothing will
change.”

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 28-39 which are based on Reading Passage
3 below.

Population viability analysis
Part A
To make political decisions about the extent and type of forestry in a region
it is important to understand the consequences of those decisions. One tool
for assessing the impact of forestry on the ecosystem is population viability
analysis (PVA). This is a tool for predicting the probability that a species
will become extinct in a particular region over a specific period. It has been
successfully used in the United States to provide input into resource
exploitation decisions and assist wildlife managers and there is now enormous
potential for using population viability to assist wildlife management in
Australia’s forests.
A species becomes extinct when the last individual dies. This observation is
a useful starting point for any discussion of extinction as it highlights the
role of luck and chance in the extinction process. To make a prediction about
extinction we need to understand the processes that can contribute to it and
these fall into four broad categories which are discussed below.
Part B
A Early attempts to predict population viability were based on demographic
uncertainty Whether an individual survives from one year to the next
will largely be a matter of chance. Some pairs may produce several young
in a single year while others may produce none in that same year. Small
populations will fluctuate enormously because of the random nature of
birth and death and these chance fluctuations can cause species extinctions
even if, on average, the population size should increase. Taking only this
uncertainty of ability to reproduce into account, extinction is unlikely if
the number of individuals in a population is above about 50 and the
population is growing.
B Small populations cannot avoid a certain amount of inbreeding. This is
particularly true if there is a very small number of one sex. For example,
if there are only 20 individuals of a species and only one is a male, all
future individuals in the species must be descended from that one male.
For most animal species such individuals are less likely to survive and
reproduce. Inbreeding increases the chance of extinction.

87

Practice Test 4
C Variation within a species is the raw material upon which natural selection
acts. Without genetic variability a species lacks the capacity to evolve and
cannot adapt to changes in its environment or to new predators and new
diseases. The loss of genetic diversity associated with reductions in
population size will contribute to the likelihood of extinction.
D Recent research has shown that other factors need to be considered.
Australia’s environment fluctuates enormously from year to year. These
fluctuations add yet another degree of uncertainty to the survival of many
species. Catastrophes such as fire, flood, drought or epidemic may reduce
population sizes to a small fraction of their average level. When allowance
is made for these two additional elements of uncertainty the population
size necessary to be confident of persistence for a few hundred years may
increase to several thousand.
Part C
Beside these processes we need to bear in mind the distribution of a population.
A species that occurs in five isolated places each containing 20 individuals
will not have the same probability of extinction as a species with a single
population of 100 individuals in a single locality.
Where logging occurs (that is, the cutting down of forests for timber) forestdependent creatures in that area will be forced to leave. Ground-dwelling
herbivores may return within a decade. However, arboreal marsupials (that is
animals which live in trees) may not recover to pre-logging densities for over
a century. As more forests are logged, animal population sizes will be reduced
further. Regardless of the theory or model that we choose, a reduction in
population size decreases the genetic diversity of a population and increases
the probability of extinction because of any or all of the processes listed above.
It is therefore a scientific fact that increasing the area that is loaded in any
region will increase the probability that forest-dependent animals will become
extinct.

PART ONE
You are advised to spend 20 minutes on Questions 1-14. First, read the text below and
answer Questions 1-8.

YOUR MOULEX IRON

D Pressing button
This button activates a super shot of steam
which momentarily gives you an additional 40g
of steam when needed.
Important: Do not use this more than five
successive times.

E Suits etc.
A Filling the reservoir
Your iron is designed to function using tap
water. However, it will last longer if you use
distilled water.
- Always unplug the iron before filling the
reservoir.
- Always empty the reservoir after use.

B Temperature and steam control
Your Moulex iron has two buttons which
control the intensity of heat produced by the
iron. You can, therefore, adjust the
temperature of the iron and the amount of
steam being given off depending upon the
type of fabric being ironed.
- Turn the steam control to the desired
intensity.
- Turn the thermostat control to the desired
temperature.
Important: If your iron produces droplets of
water instead of giving off steam, your
temperature control is set too low.

C Spray button
This button activates a jet of cold water which
allows you to iron out any unintentional
creases. Press the button for one second.

94

It is possible to use this iron in a vertical
position so that you can remove creases from
clothes on coathangers or from curtains.
Turning the thermostat control and the steam
button to maximum, hold the iron in a vertical
position close to the fabric but without
touching it. Hold down the pressing button for
a maximum of one second. The steam
produced is not always visible but is still able
to remove creases.
Important: Hold the iron at a sufficient
distance from silk and wool to avoid all risk of
scorching Do not attempt to remove creases
from an item of clothing that is being worn,
always use a coathanger.

F Auto-clean
In order that your iron does not become furred
up, Moulex have integrated an auto-clean
system and we advise you to use it very
regularly (1-2 times per month).
- Turn the steam control to the off position.
- Fill the reservoir and turn the thermostat
control to maximum.
- As soon as the indicator light goes out,
unplug the iron and, holding it over the sink,
turn the steam control to auto-clean. Any
calcium deposits will be washed out by the
steam. Continue the procedure until the
reservoir is empty.

Part One

Questions 1-4
Match the pictures below to the appropriate section in the instructions. Write the correct letter

General Training Module
Now, read the information below and answer Questions 9-14.

CLASSIC TOURS - COACH BREAK INFORMATION
Luggage
We ask you to keep luggage down to one medium-sized suitcase per person,
but a small holdall can also be taken on board the coach.
Seat Allocation
Requests for particular seats can be made on most coach breaks when
booking, but since allocations are made on a first come first served basis,
early booking is advisable. When bookings are made with us you will be
offered the best seats that are available on the coach at that time.
Travel Documents
When you have paid your deposit we will send to you all the necessary
documents and labels, so that you receive them in good time before the coach
break departure date. Certain documents, for example air or boat tickets,
may have to be retained and your driver or courier will then issue them to
you at the relevant point.
Special Diets
If you require a special diet you must inform us at the time of booking with a
copy of the diet. This will be notified to the hotel or hotels on your coach
break, but on certain coach breaks the hotels used are tourist class and whilst
offering value for money within the price range, they may not have the full
facilities to cope with special diets. Any extra costs incurred must be paid to
the hotel by yourself before departure from the hotel.
Accommodation
Many of our coach breaks now include, within the price, accommodation with
private facilities, and this will be indicated on the coach break page. Other
coach breaks have a limited number of rooms with private facilities which,
subject to availability, can be reserved and guaranteed at the time of booking
- the supplementary charge shown in the price panel will be added to your
account.
On any coach break there are only a limited number of single rooms. When a
single room is available it may be subject to a supplementary charge and this
will be shown on the brochure page.
Entertainment
Some of our hotels arrange additional entertainment which could include
music, dancing, film shows, etc. The nature and frequency of the
entertainment presented is at the discretion of the hotel and therefore not
guaranteed and could be withdrawn if there is a lack of demand or
insufficient numbers in the hotel.

Part Three

D Once collected, the paper has to be
sorted by hand by people trained to
recognise various types of paper. This
is necessary because some types of
paper can only be made from particular
kinds of recycled fibre. The sorted
paper then has to be repulped or mixed
with water and broken down into its
individual fibres. This mixture is called
stock and may contain a wide variety of
contaminating materials, particularly if it
is made from mixed waste paper which
has had little sorting. Various machinery is used to remove other materials
from the stock. After passing through
the repulping process, the fibres from
printed waste paper are grey in colour
because the printing ink has soaked
into the individual fibres. This recycled
material can only be used in products
where the grey colour does not matter,
such as cardboard boxes but if the grey
colour is not acceptable, the fibres
must be de-inked. This involves adding
chemicals such as caustic soda or
other alkalis, soaps and detergents,
water-hardening agents such as calcium chloride, frothing agents and

bleaching agents. Before the recycled
fibres can be made into paper they
must be refined or treated in such a
way that they bond together.
E Most paper products must contain
some virgin fibre as well as recycled
fibres and unlike glass, paper cannot
be recycled indefinitely. Most paper is
down-cycled which means that a product made from recycled paper is of an
inferior quality to the original paper.
Recycling paper is beneficial in that it
saves some of the energy, labour and
capital that goes into producing virgin
pulp. However, recycling requires the
use of fossil fuel, a non-renewable
energy source, to collect the waste
paper from the community and to
process it to produce new paper. And
the recycling process still creates
emissions which require treatment
before they can be disposed of safely.
Nevertheless, paper recycling is an
important economical and environmental practice but one which must be
carried out in a rational and viable
manner for it to be useful to both industry and the community.

I had my wallet in my pocket so I didn’t lose that but there were also my pens
which I got for my birthday and a novel I was planning to read on the train.
Right. Where exactly did you lose the briefcase?
Well … I couldn’t believe it. I was standing on the platform … it was right
next to me.
You were holding it?
I’d just put it down on the floor but I could almost feel it beside me. I was
watching for my tram because sometimes it comes early and then next time I
looked, my briefcase wasn’t there.
And what time was this?
Ah … it was … it must have been about 5.20 … no a bit later. I’d say 5.30

Newsreader: This is the 6 o’clock news for Tuesday 25 November. And first the
headlines:
The Prime Minister has promised to help the drought stricken farmers in the
northern part of the country who haven’t seen rain for nearly two years. And in
Sydney a group of school children are successfully rescued from a plane which
landed in the sea shortly after take-off. Transport workers are on strike in
Melbourne over a pay claim and the strike looks set to spread to other states. And
on a fashionable note, there s to be a new look for the staff of QANTAS,
Australia’s national airline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Prime Minister has pledged today that he will make two hundred and fifty
million dollars available to help the drought stricken farmers who have not seen
ram for years, get through the next five years. Money that was to have been spent
on the re-structuring of Sydney’s road system has been re-allocated to what the
P:rime Minister described as 'a more worthy cause'. Farmers are to receive
financial assistance to help see them through the worst drought in over 50 years.
Many farmers feel that while the money is welcome it has come too late to save

them and their farms from financial ruin and are angry that the government did
not act sooner.
A group of school children who were travelling in a privately chartered
aeroplane from Sydney to Queensland to take part in a musical concert found
themselves swimming for the shore when their aeroplane had to land in the sea
just three minutes after taking off from Sydney airport. The pilot managed to
bring the aircraft and its 50 passengers down safely in the calm waters of Botany
Bay where boats and pleasurecraft were able to come to the rescue of the boys.
The fact that it was a weekend meant that there were hundreds of boats in
the bay enjoying the good weather and this undoubtedly helped the rescue
operation. 'We owe our lives to the skill of the pilot,' said one of the boys, but the
pilot replied modestly that it was 'all part of a day’s work'. However, all their
musical instruments were lost and they never got to play at their concert.

Hello can I come in?
Oh yes, come in. How can I help you?
I was looking for the Economics office. I’ve been all over the Arts Faculty
building looking for it but I could only find the School of Accounting and
Economic History. Is this the right place?
Yes this is the School of Economics.
Oh good. Um, I’m a new student and I was wondering if someone could give
me some information.
Well I might be able to help. I lecture on that program. What do you need to
Know?
Quite a few things, actually. Firstly, how many lectures a week do I have to
Attend?
Ah, well, the Economics I course is a double unit so there are two lectures a
week and one tutorial. The lectures are scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday.
What time?
Let me see … You know this information is all in the handout which you
should have received yesterday at the orientation meeting.
Oh, was there a meeting yesterday? I didn’t know about that … no one mentioned …
Yes, there was, but never mind. Now lectures are at four m the afternoon.
Four’s a bit late. I’ve got a part time job that starts at four thirty.
Well, you can’t be in two places at once, can you, and attendance at lectures
is necessary. We expect at least 90% attendance at this university you know.
90%! That’s high. Do they enforce that rule?
Yes, we do. We’re pretty strict about it actually.
And what times have been set down for the tutorials — do you have that
Information?
That’s a very well attended course so there’s a number of tutorial times.

Dr. Roberts is his name.
M:
Oh, OK.

Anything else I can help you with while you’re here?
M:
Well, yes, actually. Do you know what the course requirements are? I mean,
how much work is expected for this course?
F:
Well, you have to complete a tutorial paper.
M:
What does that involve?
F:
Well, it’s a piece of work on a given topic based on some set reading texts.
You’ll have to give a small talk to your tutorial group ...
M:
How long does that have to be?
F:
Oh, about 25 minutes usually.
M:
I have to talk for 25 minutes?
F:
Yes, that’s right. And then you have to write up your piece of work and give
it to the lecturer to be marked.
M:
Right. And is that all?
F:
No. You also have to complete a 3,000 word essay on a topic.
M:
Can I choose the topic?
Yes, usually you can.
F:
M:
Right. That shouldn’t be too bad.
F:
And in addition to that there is an exam.
M:
An exam! What sort of exam?
F:
Well, it’s an open book exam.
M:
Does that mean I can have the text book with me during the exam?
F:
Yes, that’s right.
M:
And can you give me any idea about the content of the first year of
Economics so that I can get into some reading?
F:
Well, you’ll be getting the reading list next week when lectures start. All the
books are in the library.
M:
Yes, but won’t everyone else take them out as soon as they get the reading
list too?
F:
Well, yes, they might. But most of the important ones are held in Closed
Reserve ... that’s a part of the library where you can go to read books but
you can’t take them out of the building.
M:
What did you call that section of the library?
F:
Closed Reserve. However, we do recommend that you buy the core books.
You’ll find them useful and you’ll need them for the exam.
M:
Yes, I suppose I will. But what is the focus of the course?
F:
Well, the course at this university has a vocational focus, that is a focus on
preparing its graduates for work, so we’re orientated very much towards
employment.
M:
So my chances of getting a job are good?
F:
Well, provided you get good results.

SECTION 4
Lecturer:
Good morning and welcome to the University of Westlands. My name is Marcia
Mayhew and I’m the co-ordmator of the Bachelor of Social Science degree. This
morning I’d like to tell you about the structure of the university and about some
of the requirements of the degree that you’re about to enter. The Bachelor of
Social Science is in one faculty within the university, that is the faculty where I
work, known as Arts and Social Sciences. Here on this campus we also have the
faculties of Architecture, Law and Science and Technology among others.
It’s important to know something about the structure of the faculty because, as
you go through your course, you may need to call on members of the staff to help
you.
At the top of the faculty we have a dean and below the dean we have three
divisions; each division has a divisional head and your degree is located in the
Division of Social Sciences. Within each of the divisions, there are the departments
and each of these offers the different degrees. For instance two of the departments
which offer the major subjects for your award are Sociology and Psychology. Each
has a departmental head but for practical purposes the people you are going to
see the most of are myself as co-ordinator of the social sciences degree and the
actual lecturers who are teaching the subjects that you are taking. For instance in
the first semester you’ll be doing four subjects psychology sociology history and
economics.
If you have any problems or difficulties, not that I’m anticipating you will, but
you never know, then you should go and see your lecturers. For instance, you
may find that you can’t meet a deadline for an essay or perhaps you re having
problems with attendance. These seem to be the two most common problems that
students face.

Q32

Q33

Q34

Q35
Q36

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If your lecturers are unavailable, you can always come and see me in my office.
I’m available on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and on Friday afternoons
Outside these hours, perhaps you could ring the secretary and make an appointment.
Now you’ll note that all of the subjects which you undertake in the first year
are composed of lectures and tutorials. A lecture is about an hour long and a
tutorial usually runs for about two hours. A lecture is rather like what I am doing
now where one person will talk to all of you together on a subject. We do ask you
to try to attend the lectures.
A tutorial is perhaps where most of the learning occurs at a university. You will
be divided into groups of between 12 and 15 students and each week one of you
will have to present a piece of work to the group as a whole and then the group
will discuss what you’ve said. It’s this discussion, this exchange of ideas, which
really constitutes the basis of university learning, in my view. Listening to lectures
in many ways is just giving you information that you could access for yourself in

Q37

Q38

111

Practice Test 2
the library but the discussion at the tutorial is very important. This doesn’t mean
that you shouldn’t go to the lectures though!
Other factors to be particularly concerned about are the structure of essays and
delivery of written material and in particular I would like to mention the question
of plagiarism. Plagiarism is taking other people’s work without acknowledging it,
that is, without saying where it comes from. Of course all essays are based on
research done by other people but you must remember to attribute the work to the
original writer. And while it’s a good idea to work with other people don’t hand
in work which is exactly the same as your friend’s work because we will notice! If
you don’t acknowledge the source of your information then you run the risk of
failing the subject or in very serious cases you might be denied entry to the university.
Last but not least, stay in touch with us. If things are getting you down, don’t
go and hide. Come and talk to us about it. That’s what we are here for. Right,
thank you very much for coming along today.

I’m doing a Masters by coursework in Environmental Studies.
Ah, right, and how are you finding that?
Yeah, well, it’s been pretty good really. I’ve enjoyed the course, but I feel
there hasn’t been enough contact with the lecturers. They all seem to be
incredibly busy. The only chance I’ve really had to talk to them was on the
field trip.
Well that’s no good. Could anything be done to improve the course in your
opinion?
Well … I think it would be helpful to have meetings with lecturers on the
course. Say once a fortnight — something like that.

time.

over there. Now let’s go back to Kate...

SECTION 2
Radio presenter:
Well, last week we talked about buying camping equipment and today I’d like to
talk to you about buying a bicycle. A simple enough exercise, you might imagine,
but there are lots of things to look out for to make sure you get the best deal for
your money.
Well, the range of bicycles is enormous — there are racing bikes, touring bikes,
mountain bikes or just plain ordinary bikes for riding round town. They vary
enormously in two basic ways: price and quality. This means that the choice you
make will probably be determined by the amount of money you want to pay, your
own personal needs, what is actually available or a compromise of all three things.
However, in broad terms you can spend anything from $50 to $2,000 on a bike so,
you’ll need to know what you are looking for.
Single speed cycles — that is bikes with no gears, are really only suited to short,
casual rides. Their attraction is their simplicity and reliability. After years of
neglect they still manage to function, though not always too efficiently. If it’s basic
transport you’re after then you can’t go wrong.
Three speed cycles on the other hand are all that is really necessary for most
town riding, going to the shops and things like that. Like the single speed bike
they are simple and reliable. If you are going to be going up and down lots of
hills, then you’ll probably want something more efficient.
Five and ten speed bicycles are best suited to riding over long distances or hilly
terrain and to serious touring, so if it’s serious touring you’re interested in, get a five
or ten speed bike. However it’s worth remembering that the difference in price
between a five and ten speed cycle is usually very little and so it’s well worth
paying that little bit extra to get the ten speed one. So I would tend to recommend
the ten speed bike as the price is similar — however you’ll be getting better
quality components.
Now the next thing we need to look at is size. Buying a cycle is like buying
clothes, first of all you find the right size and then you try it on to see if it fits.
Contrary to what you might imagine, the size of the cycle is not determined by the
size of the wheels (except in children’s cycles), but by the size of the frame. So
you’ll need to measure the length of your legs and arms to get a frame that is the
right size for you.
Well, that’s all from Helpful Hints for today …

F:

M:
Yes, banana growing.
(sarcastically) Fascinating, Im sure!
F:
M:
Well
its not as boring as youd think. And I wanted to tie it in to the
work Ive been doing on primary industries and the economy. Anyway I bet
there are a few things you didnt know about bananas!
F:
Such as?
M:
Such as the fact that bananas were among the first plants ever to be
domesticated.
F:
Oh, really?
M:
Yes, theyre an extremely nourishing food.
F:
I suppose youre going to tell me the whole history of banana growing now
arent you?
M:
Well, itd be a good practice run for my tutorial next week. Ill do the same
for you some time.
F:
OK. Fire away. So where were these bananas first domesticated?
M:
According to my research, the Cavendish banana, which is a type of banana
and the first type to be cultivated here, actually originated in China but they
had a fairly roundabout route before they got to Australia.
F:
You mean they didnt go straight from China to Australia?
M:
No, they didnt. It seems that in 1826, bananas were taken from South China
to England.
F:
I suppose they would have made a welcome addition to the English diet.
M:
Yes, Im sure. Well apparently there was an English Duke who was
particularly fond of bananas and he used to cultivate them in his hothouse,
which is where you have to grow them in England, of course, because of the
cool climate and they became quite popular in the UK. So he was the one
responsible for cultivating the Cavendish banana which was then introduced
into Australia.
F:
I see. And weve been growing them ever since?
M:
Yes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------F:
Are they hard to grow?
M:
Well, yes and no. To grow them in your garden, no, not really. But to grow
them commercially you need to know what you’re doing. You see you only
get one bunch of bananas per tree and it can take up to three years for a tree
to bear fruit if you don’t do anything special to it. But this period is greatly
reduced with modern growing methods, particularly in plantations where you
have perfect tropical conditions.
F:
Right! So what are you looking at? One year? Two years?
M:
No, no, around 15 months in good conditions for a tree to produce a bunch of
bananas. And once youve got your bunch you cut the bunch and the plant down.
F:
So how do the trees reproduce then?
M:
Well, bananas are normally grown from suckers which spring up around the
parent plant, usually just above the plant. They tend to like to grow uphill 
or at least thats the common wisdom.

So that’s why banana plantations are usually on hillsides, is it?
Yes. They grow best like that.
That’s interesting!
If you plant them in rich soil and give them plenty of water at the beginning
of summer, then they should be well advanced by the beginning of winter
when growth virtually stops. But in a country like England, theyre hard to
grow, although you can grow them in a hothouse.
But in Australia, its not difficult?
No, though even here, the growers put plastic bags around the bunches to
protect them and keep them warm. If you go up to the banana growing
districts, youll see all these banana trees with plastic bags on them.
But how do they stop the bananas going bad before they reach the shops?
Well, the banana bunches are picked well before the fruit is ripe. Once you
cut the bunch, the bananas stop growing but they do continue to ripen. The
interesting thing is that once one banana ripens, it gives off a gas which then
helps all the others to ripen so they pretty much all ripen within a few hours
of each other.
Amazing! So do we export lots of bananas overseas, to Europe and Asia for
instance?
Well, oddly enough, no. I believe New Zealand takes a small proportion of
the crop but otherwise theyre mostly grown for the domestic market, which
is surprising when you think about it because we grow an enormous number
of bananas each year.
Yes, well thank you for all that information. Im sure the tutorial paper will
go really well you certainly seem to have done your research on the subject.
Lets hope so.

Good morning, good morning, everyone, and welcome to our regular lecture
on health issues. This series of lectures is organised by the Students’ Union
and is part of the union’s attempt to help you, the students of this university,
to stay healthy while coping with study and social life at the same time. So
it’s a great pleasure for me to welcome back Ms Diane Greenbaum who is a
professional dietician and who has been kind enough to give up her time, in
what I know is a very hectic schedule, to come along and talk to us today.
Thank you. Thank you very much, John. May I say it’s a pleasure to be
back. Now, stresses at university, being away from home and having to look
after yourselves, learning your way around the campus all contribute to
making it quite hard sometimes to ensure that your diet is adequate. So
today I’m going to talk about ways of making sure that you eat well while at
the same time staying within your budget.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have a well balanced diet, then you should be getting all the vitamins

Q35

Tapescripts
that you need for normal daily living. However sometimes we think we’re
eating the right foods but the vitamins are escaping, perhaps as a result of
cooking and anyway we’re not getting the full benefit of them. Now, if you
lack vitamins in any way the solution isn’t to rush off and take vitamin pills.
though they can sometimes help. No it’s far better to look at your diet and
how you prepare your food.
So what are vitamins? Well, the dictionary tells us they are food factors
essential in small quantities to maintain life. Now, there are fat soluble
vitamins which can be stored for quite some time by the body and there are
water soluble vitamins which are removed more rapidly from the body and
so a regular daily intake of these ones is needed.
OK, so how can you ensure that your diet contains enough of the vitamins
you need? Well, first of all, you may have to establish some new eating
habits! No more chips at the uni canteen, Im afraid! Now firstly, you must
eat a variety of foods. Then you need to ensure that you eat at least four
servings of fruit and vegetables daily. Now youll need to shop two or three
times a week to make sure that theyre fresh, and store your vegetables in the
fridge or in a cool dark place.
Now let s just refresh our memories by looking at the Healthy Diet
Pyramid. OK, can you all see that? Good. Well ,now, as you see weve got
three levels to our pyramid. At the top in the smallest area are the things
which we should really be trying to avoid as much as possible. Things like
Example yes, sugar, salt, butter
all that sort of thing.
Next, on the middle of our pyramid we find the things that we can eat in
moderation. Not too much though! And thats where we find milk, lean meat,
fish, nuts, eggs. And then at the bottom of the pyramid are the things that
you can eat lots of! Because theyre the things that are really good for you
And here we have bread, vegetables and fruit. So dont lose sight of your
healthy diet pyramid when you do your shopping.

A Ford. Fine! Well, I’ll just get you to sign here and when you’ve paid the
cashier I’ll be able to issue you with the sticker.
Right. Where do I pay?
Just across the corridor in the cashier’s office. Oh, but it’s 12.30 now and
they close at 12.15 for lunch. But they open again at a quarter past two until
4.30
Oh .. they’re not open till quarter past two?
No. When you get your sticker, you must attach it to the front windscreen of
your car. I m afraid it’s not valid if you don’t have it stuck on the window.
Right, I see. Thanks very much I’ll just wait here then.

Guide:
Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Maritime Museum.
Now before we commence our tour I’d just like to tell you a little bit about the
history of the museum As you can see, it’s a very modern building built in the
post modern style and it was in fact opened by the Prime Minister of Australia
in November 1991. It’s been designed with a nautical flavour in mind to remind us of
our links with the sea. But the museum isn’t only housed in this building, there are
a number of historic ships docked outside in the harbour which form part of the
museum and which you are also free to visit, and we’ll be coming to them shortly
I’d just like to point out one or two things of general interest while we’re here.
Handicapped toilets are located on this floor and the door shows a wheelchair.
The cloakroom where you can hang your coat or leave your bags is just behind us
here. The education centre is on the top floor and there’s a good little library in
there which you might like to use. Follow the signs to the Education Centre —
you’ll see a lot of little green arrows on the wall. The green arrows will take you
there. The information desk, marked with the small letter i on your plan is located
right here in the foyer, so if you get separated from your friends, I suggest you
make your way back to the information desk because we’ll be returning to this
spot at the end of the tour. All right?
Now if you look out this window you should be able to see where the
museums ships are docked. If you want to go on a tour of the old ship, the
Vampire, shes docked over there and you should meet outside on the quay.
However a word of warning! I dont recommend it for the grandmas and
grandpas because there are lots of stairs to climb. Right, now, lets move on
Oh, I almost forgot to give you the times for that tour. Now, tours of the Vampire
run on the hour every hour. All right?

Cook, so come back here later on if you want to learn more about Captain Cook.
Now, we’re moving along the gallery known as the Leisure Gallery. This is one
of our permanent exhibitions and here we try to give you an idea of the many
different ways in which Australians have enjoyed their time by the sea: surfing,
swimming, lifesavmg clubs, that’s all very much a part of Australian culture. At the
end of this section we’ll come to the Picture Gallery where we’ve got a marvellous
collection of paintings all by Australian artists. I think you can buy reproductions
of some of these paintings in the museum shop. Well worth a good look.
Now we’re coming to the Members’ Lounge. As a member of the museum you
would be entitled to use the members’ lounge for refreshments. Membership costs
$50 a year or $70 for all the family. So it’s quite good value because entry to the
museum is then free.
And down at the far end of this floor, you’ll find the section which we’ve called
Passengers and the Sea. In this part of the museum we’ve gathered together a
wonderful collection of souvenirs from the old days when people travelled by ship.
You’ll find all sorts of things there: old suitcases, ships’ crockery, first class cabins
decorated in the fashion of the day. Just imagine what it must have been like to
travel first class.

OK, everybody, good morning! It’s Mark’s turn to talk to us today so
Mark, I’ll ask you to get straight down to business.
Right!
Now following on from what we were discussing last week in Susan’s tutorial
on approaches to marketing, you were going to give us a quick run down on
a new strategy for pricing which is now being used by many large companies
known as “revenue management” … before we go on to your actual tutorial
paper on Sales Targets. Is that correct?
Yeah, OK, well …
So what exactly is revenue management?
Well, it’s a way of managing your pricing by treating things like airline
tickets and hotel rooms rather more as if they were perishable goods.
Yeah, I just tried to book a ticket yesterday for Perth and would you believe
there are three different prices for the flight?
Right! And what was the rationale for that?
Well … the travel agent said it depended on when you book and the length
of the stay, like it’s cheap if you stay away for a Saturday night, presumably
because this isn’t business travel and even cheaper if you buy a ticket where

you can’t get a refund if you have to cancel; in that case the ticket costs
about half the price. You wouldn’t think it would make that much
difference, would you?
Well it does, and that’s basically because the airlines are now treating their
seats like a commodity. You see — if you want a seat today, then you pay far
more for it than if you want it in three weeks’ time.
That seems rather unfair.
Well … not really … when you think about it, that’s just common sense isn t
if?
I suppose so.
What this actually means is that in the same row of seats on the same flight
you could have three people who have all paid a different price for their
tickets.
And is this just happening in Australia?
No, no it’s the same all over the world. Airlines are able to “market” a seat as
a perishable product, with different values at different stages of its life.
Well like mangoes or apples at the market.
Yeah, it’s exactly like that. The fact is that the companies are not actually
interested in selling you a cheap flight! They’re interested in selling the seats
and flying aeroplanes that are full.
Mark why do you think revenue management has come about?
Well, as far as I can see there are two basic reasons: firstly because the law
has been changed to allow the companies to do this. You see in the past they
didn’t have the right to keep changing the prices of the tickets, and secondly
we now have very powerful computer programs to do the calculations and so
the prices can be changed at a moment’s notice.
So you mean ten minutes could be critical when you’re buying a plane ticket?
Absolutely!
That’s right!
And I understand we have almost reached the stage where these computer
programs that the airlines are using will eventually be available to consumers
to find the best deals for their travel plans from their home computer
Heavens! What a thought! So the travel agent could easily become a thing of
the past if you could book your airline tickets from home. Are there any
other industries using this system, or is it restricted to the airline business?
Many of the big hotel groups are doing it now. That’s why the price of a bed
in a hotel can also vary so much … depending on when and where you book
it
It’s all a bit of a gamble really.
Yes, and hire car companies are also using revenue management to set their
tariffs, because they are also dealing with a “commodity” if you like … so the
cost of hiring a car will depend on demand.
Well, thank you, Mark, for that overview … that was well researched. Now
let’s get on with your main topic for today…

SECTION 4
Marketing Consultant:
Good morning. Welcome to this talk on Space Management. And today I’m going
to look particularly at space management in the supermarket.
Now since the time supermarkets began, marketing consultants, like us, have
been gathering information about customers’ shopping habits.
To date, various research methods have been used to help promote the sales of
supermarket products. There is, for example, the simple and direct questionnaire
which provides information from customers about their views on displays and
products and then helps retailers make decisions about what to put where.
Another method to help managers understand just how shoppers go around
their stores are the hidden television cameras that film us as we shop and monitor
our physical movement around the supermarket aisles: where do we start, what do
we buy last, what attracts us, etc.
More sophisticated techniques now include video surveillance and such devices
as the eye movement recorder. This is a device which shoppers volunteer to wear
taped into a headband, and which traces their eye movements as they walk round
the shop recording the most eye-catching areas of shelves and aisles.
But with today’s technology. Space Management is now a highly sophisticated
method of manipulating the way we shop to ensure maximum profit. Supermarkets
are able to invest millions of pounds in powerful computers which tell them what
sells best and where.
Now, an example of this is Spaceman which is a computer program that helps
the retailer to decide which particular product sells best in which part of the store.
Now Spaceman works by receiving information from the electronic checkouts
(where customers pay) on how well a product is selling in a particular position.
Spaceman then suggests the most profitable combination of an article and its
position in the store.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, let’s have a look at what we know about supermarkets and the way people
behave when they walk down the aisles and take the articles they think they need
from the shelves.
Now here’s a diagram of one supermarket aisle and two rows of shelves. Here’s
the entrance at the top left-hand corner.
Now products placed here, at the beginning of aisles, don’t sell well. In tests,
secret fixed cameras have filmed shoppers’ movements around a store over a seven-day
period. When the film is speeded up, it clearly shows that we walk straight past
these areas on our way to the centre of an aisle. Items placed here just don’t
attract people.
When we finally stop at the centre of an aisle, we pause and take stock, casting
our eyes along the length of it. Now products displayed here sell well and do even
better if they are placed at eye level so that the customer’s eyes hit upon them
instantly. Products here are snapped up and manufacturers pay a lot for these
shelf areas which are known in the trade as hotspots. Naturally everyone wants
their products to be in a hotspot.
But the prime positions in the store are the ends of the aisles, otherwise known
as Gondola ends. Now these stand out and grab our attention. For this reason new

122

Tapescripts
products are launched in these positions and manufacturers are charged widely
varying prices for this privileged spot. Also, the end of an aisle may be used for
promoting special offers which are frequently found waiting for us as we turn the
corner of an aisle.
Well, now, eventually of course, we have to pay. Any spot where a supermarket
can be sure we are going to stand still and concentrate for more than a few
seconds is good for sales. That’s why the shelves at the checkout have long been a
favourite for manufacturers of chocolates — perhaps the most sure-fire “impulse”
food of all.

SECTION 2
Speaker:
Thanks for turning up today, thanks for turning up toddy to this short talk I’m
going to give on student banking. Many of you are unfamiliar with the way banks
work in this country and today’s talk should just give you a few starting points. I
will of course answer any questions at the end.
Right. Well ,as you probably know, you’ll need to open a bank account while
you’re here — it’s the safest place to keep your money and it’s best to open an
account with one of the major banks. You should each have a handout with the
names and addresses … there’s Barclays in Realty Square, National Westminster in
Preston Park, Lloyds in City Plaza and Midland in Hope Street. OK. All these banks
offer special student accounts. However, it’s important to note that as an
international student you’ll not necessarily be eligible for all the facilities offered to
resident students.
Now, as an international student you will need to provide evidence that you can
fund yourself for however long your course lasts. Banks have different policies and
the services that they’ll offer you will depend on your individual circumstances and
on the discretion of the bank manager involved. So it’s a matter of going there and
finding out about your own particular situation.
Right, erm, when you do go to open a bank account, you should take some
documentation with you. I’ve already mentioned that you must be able to support
yourself. In addition to this most banks ask you to bring your passport and your
letter or certificate of enrolment. OK?
Now, by far the most useful type of account to open is a current account. When
you do this, you will actually get what is called a “student account” which is a
current account with special concessions for students. When you open the account,
the bank will give you a chequebook and you can use this to draw money out
as you need it. If you need to write cheques in shops, you’ll also need a cheque
card. This is really an identity card which guarantees that correctly written cheques
up to the value stated on the card will be honoured by the bank. OK?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Right, er, if you want to draw out cash for yourself you can make the cheque
payable in your own name or “to cash”. You can also withdraw cash from a
cashpoint machine with a cashcard. These are extremely useful as they enable you
to withdraw cash from your account during the day or at night.
There is also another card called Switch or Delta and you can use this to pay for
things in shops. It takes the money right out of your account, so you don’t need
your chequebook.
Now — you may want to take more money out of the bank than you have in it.
This is called having an overdraft. Be very careful with this you should not do
this without permission from your bank. Overdrafts usually incur charges though
some banks offer interest-free overdrafts to some students. But find out before you
get one! Right?
Well, that just leaves opening times — when can you go? Banks used to be open
from 9.30 am until 3.30 pm from Monday to Friday but many main branches are
now open until 4.30 or 5 pm on weekdays and some of the bigger branches in

Hi, Dawn.
Oh hi, Ilmar.
I’m glad I’ve bumped into you. I’ve just found a great idea for the
presentation we’ve got to do for Dr Banks next month.
What, the one on everyday objects?
Yes ... look at this article ... it’s really interesting.
The aluminium coke can?
You know ... coca cola cans, soft drink cans. Look let’s sit down here. Have
you got a minute?
Sure ... I’ll just get my bag.
OK, so you think we can get a presentation out of this article?
I’m sure we can. First of all we can provide some interesting facts about the
aluminium cans that we drink out of every day.
Like ... ?
Well, here ... it says that in the US they produce 300 million aluminium
drink cans each day.
Wow! 300 million!
Exactly. That’s an enormous number. It says here “outstrips the production
of nails or paper clips”. And they say that the manufacturers of these cans
exercise as much attention and precision in producing them as aircraft
manufacturers do when they make the wing of an aircraft!
Really! Let’s have a look.
They’re trying to produce the perfect can - as thin but as strong as possible.
Mmm ... this bit’s interesting ... “today”s can weighs about 0.48 ounces:
thinner than two pieces of paper ... from this magazine say.’
Yeah, and yet it can take a lot of weight.
More than 90 pounds of pressure per square inch — three times the pressure
of a car tyre. OK, I agree, it’s a good topic.

What I thought was that we could do a large picture of a coke can and label
it and then talk about the different parts. Look, I’ve done a rough picture
here.
OK, so where shall we start?
Well, the lid is complicated. Let’s start with the body first. I’ll do a line from
the centre of the can ... like this ... and label it “body “. What does it say?
It”s made of aluminium, of course, and it’s thicker at the bottom.
Right, so that it can take all that pressure.

And then I think you should draw another line from the body for the label.
Right “label”. The aluminium is ironed out until it’s so thin that it produces
what does it say?
“A reflective surface suitable for decoration.”
That’s right apparently it helps advertisers, too.
Yes, because it’s so attractively decorated.
Good … and then there’s the base.
Yes, it says the bottom of the can is shaped like a dome so that it can resist
the internal pressure.
That’s interesting. I didn’t know that.
Nor did I. OK, so going up to the lid … there are several things we can label
here. There’s the rim around the edge which seals the can.
Got that. And there’s a funny word for the seal isn’t there?
Yes, it’s a flange
What does it say about it?
Well, the can’s filled with coke or whatever and after that the top of the can
is trimmed and then bent over to secure the lid.
That’s right, it looks like a seam. We could even do a blow-up of it like this
F-L-A-N-G-E ...
Yes, that would be clearer. I think we should label the lid itself and say that
it constitutes twenty five percent of the total weight.
Twenty-five percent … so it’s stronger than the body of the can.
So to save money, manufacturers make it smaller than the rest of the can!
Didn’t know that either ... so how do we open a can of coke?
Mmm … first of all there’s the tab which we pull up to open the can and
that’s held in place by a rivet.
Mmm … I think that’s too small for us to include.
I agree, but we can talk about it in the presentation. We can show the
opening though
That’s the bit of the can that drops down into the drink when we pull the
tab.
Yeah, hopefully. Sometimes the tab just breaks off.
I know.
Anyway the opening is scored so that it pushes in easily but doesn’t detach
itself.
OK, we can show that by drawing a shadow of it inside the can, like this I’ll
label it scored opening. Great … well, I think we’ve got the basis of a really
interesting presentation. Let’s go and photocopy the article.
Fine. I’ll take it home and study it some more.

SECTION 4
Lecturer:
Good morning and welcome to the University’s Open Day and to our mini-lecture
from the Sports Studies department. Now the purpose of this lecture is twofold:
one — we want you to experience a university lecture, to give you a taste of what
listening to a university lecture is like, and two — we want you to find out
something about the Sports Studies program at this university. So feel free to ask
any questions during the talk and I’ll do my best to answer them.
Right — so what does a course in Sports Studies involve? Well, you wouldn’t be
blamed for not knowing the answer to this question because Sports Studies as a
discipline is still comparatively new. But it’s a growing area and one which is now
firmly established at our university.
Now there are three distinct strands to Sports Studies and you would need to
choose fairly early on just which direction you wanted to follow. And I’ll just run
over these now. Firstly, we’ve got the Sports Psychology strand, secondly, we’ve
got the Sports Management strand, and last, but not least, there’s the Sports
Physiology strand. So Just to recap there’s Sports Psychology, Sports Management,
and Sports Physiology.
Let’s look first at Psychology. Now the people who study Sports Psych want to
work with top athletes, and they’re looking at what will take those athletes that
one percent extra. What makes them win? When all other things are equal,
physically all other things are equal, they want to know … what are the mental
factors involved? The Sports Psychologist works closely with the athlete through
his or her training program and becomes an integral part of the team. In fact you
could say that they play just as important a role as the coach. So if you’re
interested in what makes people win this could be the area for you.
Now secondly, we’ve got the strand which I referred to as Sports Management
and this goes hand in hand with the area of Sports Marketing. So you might like
to think of this area as having two branches: Management and Marketing. On the
Management side we look at issues relating to the running of sports clubs,
management of athletes that sort of thing. But then on the other side, we’ve got
Sports Marketing. And this is the side that interests me more because here we will
look at the market forces behind sport. Questions like: why do people spend their
money on a football match, or a tennis game rather, than say on buying a CD or
going to the cinema? What are those market forces?
Sport used to just compete with sport. Nowadays it competes with other leisure
activities. The spectators go to sport to be entertained rather than out of loyalty to
a team. They want to have an evening out and they don’t want the cheap seats any
more they want good seats they want entertainment. And the professional
sportsmen and women respond to this without question. They’re there to give a
performance. They provide the entertainment. So in the marketing course we
address all these commercial issues and we look at how this hooks back into the
Management of sport.
Now the third branch of Sports Studies sometimes comes under another name
and is also known as Exercise Science. And again here we find that there are two
distinct types of exercise science. The first is working very much at the macro level.
What I call the huffing and puffing people. So this looks at fitness testing, body

measurements, all that sort of thing. But the more interesting side of sports
physiology, at least in my view, is the side that looks at the micro level, looking at
cellular change. They’re doing cellular research, looking at changes in body cells
when the body is under stress.

Questions 9-15

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. In this task you
have to decide which match is being described
in each question.
• Decide what information is best to skim for in
the passage: the type of match or the
description. In this question it is best to skim
for the types of match as these are names, some
of which are in italics, they are easier for you to
pick out.
• Skim through the text until you find match A,
the Ethereal Match.
• Read that section of the text and underline any
important features of this match.
• Read through the descriptions and write A next
to any that fit this type of match.

If you think there is more than one possible
description for the match, note A next to both.
(The rubric states that you may use any match
more than once. )
• Towards the top of the second page of the text
it states that the Ethereal Match consisted of a
“sealed glass tube”, so A is the answer to
question 14. Note that the description is
expressed differently from the text. Sometimes
you have to match the meaning rather than the
words.
• If you think none of the descriptions fits this
type of match, go on to the next the rubric also
states that there are not enough descriptions to
fit all the matches.

You can infer from what the writer
then states, that A is one of the correct factors.
• Re-read the list of factors from B-F.
• Continue reading the text, looking for other
signals.
• Select the two other correct factors.
Remember that if you put more than one factor

Questions 26-28

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. Only three of the
factors in the list are correct. The correct
factors explain why the author doubts the value
of the WZCS document.
• Scan the text and mark the section that
discusses the accuracy/value of theWZCS
document. This is from the third paragraph
onwards.
• Read through the list of factors to familiarise
yourself with it.
• Begin reading the third paragraph more
carefully, looking for phrases that signal that
the writer is going to discuss something that is
wrong with the document. The first signal is:

Questions 36-40

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. You have to
decide which effect arose from each cause.
• Decide which list you should work from. In
this case it is better to work from List A as you
must find an effect m List B for every question.
The causes also come first chronologically in
the cause/effect relationship: List B contains
results of List A.
• Read through List B to familiarise yourself
with it.
• Read item 36.
• Skim through the passage until you locate the
information in the text.
• Read this section of the text in detail noting any
effects of 36.
• Read through List B again.
• Select the effect of question 36. If you think
there is more than one effect, mark both and
come back to this item later. But remember that

Questions 1-7

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. You have to
match the opinions with the people who express
them in the text.
• Read through the list of opinions to familiarise
yourself with it.
• In this case it is probably best to skim through
the text looking for names as these are easy to
identify. So skim through the text until you
come to the first name: Professor Turner.
• The text states in the first paragraph that
Professor Turner has studied left-handedness. It
goes on to say that he noted a “distinctive
asymmetry” in the human population.
• Skim through the list of opinions again Number
7 states “Asymmetry is a common feature of
the human body”. So the answer to question 7
is E.
• Continue this procedure with the rest of the
text. Note that the opinions in the questions are
expressed differently from the text. This is
known as “paraphrasing”. It means that you
will have to match the meaning rather than the
exact words

Questions 13-19

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. You have to
complete the flow chart of the movements of a
migratory beekeeper.
• Read through the flow chart to familiarise
yourself with it.
• Scan the text and note the section that
discusses the beekeepers’ movements. In this
case, the information is scattered throughout
the text, so it is important to have a good idea
of what you are looking for.
• Go back to the first box in the flow chart. Note
that this box focuses on the start of migration.
• Re-skim the text until you come to this
information. It is cued in the fourth paragraph:
“By early March …”
• The flow chart will express the movements
differently from the text. This is called
“paraphrasing”. The fourth paragraph is all
about the beekeepers’ preparations. So the
answer to item 13 is “prepare”.
• Go on to item 14. Remember that you will not
use all the words in the box, and although
some of the words in the box may seem to fit
in the gaps, they have an incorrect meaning.
Your summary must be an accurate reflection
of what is stated in the passage.

Questions 38-41

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. By choosing the
correct phrase A-H, you will make summary
points of the information given in the passage.
• It is obviously best to work from the questions
as these are the start of each sentence.
• Read through item 38.
• Read through the list of phrases to familiarise
yourself with them.
• Skim through the passage looking for key
words that indicate that the information in
question 38 is going to be discussed. For item
38, this occurs in paragraph B. In the middle of
the paragraph you read: “… the
popular concept of tourism is that …’. But to

diagram summarises most of the information in
the passage.
• Look at item 7. This box describes an input into
the Language Activator that is not part of the

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you
must use a maximum of three words for each
answer, but that these do not have to be taken
from the passage.
• You can take a straightforward approach to this
set of questions as the items are not dependent
upon each other.
• Read question 21 and note that you need to
complete the sentence with the reason why
developers prefer mass-produced housing.
• Skim through the text for a reference to
developers and/or mass produced housing.
• This information is located in paragraph F.
Here you will read the sentence: “In Europe the
obstacle has been conservative local authorities
and developers who prefer to ensure quick sales
with conventional mass produced housing.”
• From this sentence you can understand that the
reason why they prefer such housing is because
it sells quickly.

140

• Read question 21 again remembering that you
have to complete the sentence using a
grammatically correct form of the answer. In
this case, “sell quickly” is the best answer.
• Repeat this procedure with items 22-26.

Questions 27-32

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you
have to make a judgement about the writer’s
views.
• Note, also, the difference between NO (which
contradicts the writer’s views) and NOT
GIVEN (which means that the writer doesn’t
mention this at all).
• Read question 27. You have to decide whether
the writer states that employees have fewer
working hours today (compared with the past).
• Skim through the passage to see if you can
come across this information or any
contradictory information.
• The first paragraph states that working hours
were reduced after the industrial revolution.
However in the second paragraph, the writer
states that “… working hours have increased
noticeably since 1970 …” and if you read on
this fact is reiterated. So the statement (Q27)
actually says the opposite of what the writer
says. The answer to question 27 is therefore
NO.

in the passage.
• Read paragraph A and look at the example.
• Skim through the list of paragraph headings to
familiarise yourself with them.
• Read paragraph B and underline parts that are
relevant to the main focus of the paragraph.
• Paragraph B begins “On the horizon”
suggesting that it is going to discuss a future
use of glass. It goes on to discuss fibre optics
and how they could be used in the future to
improve optical instruments. Phrases such as
“could function hundreds of times faster” and
“the surge in fibre optic use” all indicate that
this paragraph is about “Exciting innovations in
fibre optics”. So viii is the heading for
paragraph B.
• Go on to paragraph C.
• If you think there is more than one possible
heading for a paragraph, re-read the paragraph
and try to decide which heading is most
appropriate.
• If you cannot decide go on to the next
paragraph — you can come back to any
questions that you can’t do, later.

Questions 24-27

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you
must use a maximum of three words for each
answer.
• You can take a straightforward approach to this
set of questions.
• Read question 24. Note that it makes reference
to the annual survey.
• Skim through the text until it discusses an
annual survey. This is in paragraph D.
• Look for a comment on changing numbers of
female managers or directors. In the text the
survey is quoted as showing a “doubling of the
numbers”. Thus the change referred to in the
question is the fact that the numbers have
doubled.
• Read the question again to make sure you give

Questions 32-35

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. Note that these
questions are based on Part B of the reading
passage. You will have to decide which
paragraphs in this part cover which processes.
• Note that there are two extra processes which
are not described. The extra processes will be
close to the correct answers but not correct.
Read the text carefully so that you do not fall
into any traps.
• Read through the list of processes to familiarise
yourself with them.
• Read paragraph A carefully, noting any
sections that relate to the processes described in
i - vi.
• Paragraph A states that survival of a species is
largely a “matter of chance” and that not all
animals produce young at the same rate. The
meaning of this paragraph can therefore be
glossed as “the haphazard nature of
reproduction” and vi is the correct answer to
question 32.

them are about seating on the coach. The
section entitled “Seat Allocation” refers
specifically to this.
• Skim through that section of the text and find
out what you have to do if you want to sit at the
front of the coach.
• This paragraph focuses entirely on the
importance of booking early if you want a
particular seat. So the answel to question 9 is C.

Questions 22-29

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you
have to make a judgement about the list of
statements.
• Note the difference between information that is
false (i.e. the passage says the opposite) and
information that is not given (i.e. not stated in
the passage at all).
• Read question 22. This statement is about
overnight accommodation.
• Scan the paragraph headings for a reference to
accommodation. The first heading is
“Accommodation”
• Skim through this section of the text to see if
there is any information about how long you
can stay at the club for. At the end of the
section it states: “long and short stays
welcomed”. So the answer to question 22 is
True.
• Repeat this procedure with questions 23-29.

Questions 30-36

Suggested approach
• Read the task rubric carefully.. You have to
complete the summary by filling in the spaces
with words from the passage. The words must
fit in meaning and also be grammatically
correct.
• Read the summary to familiarise yourself with
it. It may be possible to find words without
reading the original text, but if you do this you
may pick words which are not in the text, in
which case your answer will be incorrect. So
you must look for a word within the passage
which has the right meaning and which is the
correct part of speech for the space.
• Read the first item in the summary.
• Look at the text and see if you can find the
same information there. For item 30, the first
sentence discusses the qualities of paper that
make it different from other waste products.
The text states that paper comes from a
“sustamable resource”. So “sustamable” is a
correct answer.
• Sometimes there are alternative answers that
are correct in this type of question. For item 30,
“replaceable” is also a possible answer because
it says a little further on in the text, “trees are
replaceable”.
• Note however that “renewable” is not an
acceptable answer because although it is a
synonym and makes sense, it is not in the
original text.

Practice Test 3, Writing Task 1

The chart below shows the amount of money per week spent on fast foods
in Britain. The graph shows the trends in consumption of fast-foods.
Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown
below.
You should write at least 150 words.
Model answer 165 words
The chart shows that high income earners consumed considerably more fast
foods than the other income groups, spending more than twice as much on
hamburgers (43 pence per person per week) than on fish and chips or pizza
(both under 20 pence). Average income earners also favoured hamburgers,
spending 33 pence per person per week, followed by fish and chips at 24 pence,
then pizza at 11 pence. Low income earners appear to spend less than other
income groups on fast foods, though fish and chips remains their most popular
fast food, followed by hamburgers and then pizza.
From the graph we can see that in 1970, fish and chips were twice as popular as
burgers, pizza being at that time the least popular fast food. The consumption of
hamburgers and pizza has risen steadily over the 20 year period to 1990 while the
consumption of fish and chips has been in decline over that same period with a
slight increase in popularity since 1985.

Practice Test 3, Writing Task 2

You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.
Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist
knowledge of the following topic:
News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to
print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these
decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it he better if
more good news was reported?
You should write at least 250 words.
Use your own ideas knowledge and experience and support your arguments with
examples and relevant evidence.
Model answer: 300 words
It has often been said that “Good news is bad news” because it does not sell
newspapers. A radio station that once decided to present only good news soon
found that it had gone out of business for lack of listeners. Bad news on the other
hand is so common that in order to cope with it, we often simply ignore it. We have
become immune to bad news and the newspapers and radio stations are aware of
this.
While newspapers and TV stations may aim to report world events accurately, be
they natural or human disasters, political events or the horrors of war, it is also
true that their main objective is to sell newspapers and attract listeners and
viewers to their stations. For this reason TV and radio stations attempt to reflect
the flavour of their station by providing news broadcasts tailor-made to suit their
listeners’ preferences. Programmes specialising in pop music or TV soap operas
focus more on local news, home issues and up-to-date traffic reports. The more
serious stations and newspapers like to provide “so called” objective news reports
with editorial comment aimed at analysing the situation.
If it is true, then, that newspapers and TV stations are tailoring their news to their
readers’ and viewers’ requirements, how can they possibly be reporting real
world events in an honest and objective light? Many radio and TV stations do, in
fact, report items of good news but they no longer call this news. They refer to
these as human interest stories and package them in programmes specialising,
for instance, in consumer affairs or local issues. Good news now comes to us in
the form of documentaries the fight against children’s cancer or AIDS, or the
latest developments in the fight to save the planet from environmental pollution.

Dear Sir,
I am writing in reply to a letter I received from you a few days ago. In your letter
you state that I am $240 overdrawn and that you will be charging me $70.
I would like to point out that the reason I am overdrawn is because of a mistake
made by your bank. If you look through your records you will see that I wrote
several weeks ago explaining the situation. For the last twelve months, I have
been paying $300 a month for a car I bought last summer. The monthly payments
were taken directly from my bank account. However, two months ago I sold the
car and I wrote to you instructing you to stop paying the monthly instalments. I
received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason,
nothing was done about it. Another $300 instalment has been paid this month and
this is the reason why I am overdrawn.
I would like you to contact the garage where I bought the car explaining your
error. I would also like you to ask them to return the money.
Yours faithfully,

As part of a class assignment you have to write about the following topic:
We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in
businesses, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things
will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a
good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?
You should write at least 250 words.
Model answer 287 words
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years
ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our
everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early
eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We
are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would
be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main
computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were
suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated
computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that
no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of
benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will,
for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the
movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the
computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails
— disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become
increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position
where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly
discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe
that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring
and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely
technological world.
