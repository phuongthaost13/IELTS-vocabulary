            Dear Ms. Lang:
            Please see the requested breakdown below. The proposed electronic truck line will be made
            of parts produced by our own factories unless otherwise noted. They will be appropriate for
            children over the age of five and controlled by small handsets. Though this is not my area of
            expertise, I personally envision this product selling well through department stores. Once you
            consider the estimated outlay, I hope we can organize a meeting to decide on the project's
            feasibility and next steps.

         To Whom It May Concern:Â·

         I currently lease a car from your company. However, I recently accepted a job in Memphis
         City, and I am going to start taking the bus. My lease agreement is number LA508. It is a
         month-to-month lease that automatically renews on the same day each month.

         My new job starts on Tuesday, September 28, so ideally I would return the car to you on
         Monday, September 27. However, if the renewal date is earlier than that Monday, I would
         rather return the car at the end of the current month's contract and make other
         transportation arrangements until my new job starts.

         Please let me know on what exact day of the month my lease ends and when I need to
         return the car.

         Thank you,

         Kana Saito

         To Whom It May Concern:

         I have a guitar that was previously owned by Mark Peckham. I found your Web site and
         thought that Hardewicke's might be interested in purchasing it for resale.

         The guitar was custom-made for Mr. Peckham by his close friend Elizabeth Dangerfield to
         celebrate the successful release of his first album. He took it on tour with him around the
         country as well as abroad. The guitar was purchased by my father at a charity auction
         hosted by Mr. Peckham 20 years ago.

         Please let me know what your purchasing procedures are and whether you buy items up
         front or take a percentage of the transaction when you resell the item.

         Thank you,
         Sophie Calvert

        unconventional upbringing in New York City with parents who began as fashion models

        Yards of Talent: A Decade of Style
        A collection of Trozelli's images spanning a decade of fashion and revealing what was in
        style, what was out of style, and then what was back in style again. The book offers a
        sweeping array of some of the top trends in fashion.

    I discovered BTW Radio over 20 years ago and have been a regular listener of your
    evening programming for at least a decade. I just want to say how much I enjoy your
    newest offering. I've been interested by many of the authors that have been featured on
    the show so far, but last evening's guest was especially entertaining. I remember James
    from when he was a little boy. I worked with his parents when they lived in New York,
    and I recall seeing James in his parents' studio most days after he got out of school. I
    was surprised to learn that he has written about his childhood, and I look forward to
    reading his new book.
    Thank you for the excellent program.

         April 18
         I frequently travel for business, often carrying fragile samples with me on the plane.
         Most carry-ans these days are soft-sided, so it was a relief to find something that
         offers adequate protection. I've been mostly happy with the carry-on, but the larger
         bags have caused some problems. My black cases look so similar to everyone else's
         that other travelers have almost taken them by mistake! More variety would be nice.
         I also have some reservations about the mechanical elements of this set. In particular,
         the retraction mechanism of the wheels appears so delicately constructed as to be in
         danger of collapse.                                                          -~-

                    day begin.
                    All employees will be included, so please plan to come in a bit

         Dear Mr. Keel,

         I am writing to confirm your group photography session at 10:00 A.M. on Saturday. As
         discussed, this photo shoot will take place at your restaurant, and I will photograph your
         staff along the wall in the main dining hall. You mentioned that your waitstaff will need to
         start getting ready for the day at 10:30 A.M., and that should not be a problem. The shoot
         should be finished by 10:30 A.M.

        Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise I will see you on Saturday!

          My name is Priti Doshi, and I'm an avid cyclist in Bangalore, India. While browsing
          online for cycling clubs, I came across IndiaTip.net. Your Web site appears to be a very
          comprehensive resource for travel articles and related news about India.

          I would like to call your attention to an electronic guidebook I recently published. It
          describes all of my favourite cycling routes in Bangalore and is complete with maps,
          kilometre markers, and detailed descriptions about points of interest. I noticed that you
          have a specific page dedicated to bicycle travel in India; a mention of my guide would
          be an ideal addition to this page.

          The book is titled Bangalore by Bike, and it can be purchased through
          www.bangalorebybike.com/AS3XK. If you could share this information with your
          readership, I would appreciate it.

          Thank you and have a great day.

    satisfied. This time, when I arrived at Franklin Airport after a long flight from
    Lima, Peru. the driver was nowhere to be found. The airplane had arrived at a

    have taken a bus.

           Dear Mr. Vogel:

           On behalf of the Highbrook Library, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your
           generous gifts. The three computers you donated from your store, along with the
           extra paper and ink, have helped us to better serve our customers. - [1] -. We now
           have five computers and they are almost always in use. In our last conversation you
           had asked how the library staff would control use. We have decided to allow library
           members to use a computer for free for two hours. Nonmembers pay $2 for one hour
           of use. We also ask all patrons to book a computer in advance because of the high
           demand. - [2] - .

           In addition, your monetary donation has allowed us to extend our hours. The library
           is now open until 8:00 P.M., Monday-Thursday, which has led to a growth in
           membership by permitting more people to visit when their workday is over. - [3] - .
           We have even had several book clubs form that meet in the evenings. Perhaps you
           would like to join one? - [4] - .

          Next year we will be investigating the possibility of adding a small cafe on the first
          floor near the community meeting room. We hope you will consider contributing to
          this project as well, if it seems promising. You will receive more information in the
          future about it.

          Thank you again for your generous support of the Highbrook Library!

           Sincerely,
           A ~ tl 0VliUey

     Questions 176-180 refer to the following e-mail and report.




         Dear Product Development Team,
         As you may know from recent sales reports for Aswebo Toys, our products are enjoying
         great success in international markets. The response to our electronic and handcrafted
         wooden toys has been very favorable. We have, in fact, had several requests from a few of
         our principal clients to expand the number of wooden toys we currently make for children
         from birth to age five.
         Consequently, in an effort to assess the prospects for Aswebo Toys' future growth in this
         area, the management team has decided that our company will, as a preliminary step,
         produce one new item intended for the early-childhood market. Belinobo Consulting has
         been hired to conduct market research on the type of toy that we will introduce. Using the
         results of their product study, the prototype will be refined and put on the market as soon
         as it is feasible to do so.
         This plan presents our company with an exciting opportunity. I'm certain that we can
         count on your dedication and initiative.

       Newsletter submissions
       The /A/C Quarterly will be undergoing several changes in the coming months in order to better
       meet the needs of our members and readers. The first of these initiatives will be to open up the
       newsletter to reader submissions, including personal accounts of events, opinion pieces, and
       photographs. This new section of the newsletter will be called Member Views and News. The
       editors believe that this is an important way to make the IAIC Quarterly more relevant and
       engaging to readers as well as more representative of the society's activity. Membership is
       available only to certified industrial chemists.
       To this end, we are now inviting members to submit their impressions about meetings and other
       events taking place in their region. We are particularly interested in the views of members of our
       Taipei affiliate, which is our latest and 23rd chapter.
       Please click here to download the submission form. All forms must be completed and sent to
       Robert Harper at rharper@iaic.org. In the event that your submission is selected for publication,
       you will receive an e-mail at the address indicated on the form. Submissions for the autumn issue
       are due on June 30.
       Finally, we continue to make improvements to the IAIC Quarterly, so please visit this Web site
       regularly for updates. We expect to finalize a new, colorful, and more visually appealing layout
       of the newsletter in the next few weeks.




         Dr. Liu,

         Thank you for your June 18 submission to our newly created Member Views and News
         section of our newsletter. We were so happy to hear about the Taipei chapter's first
         meeting, especially the details of Dr. Mei Chu's latest research in the area of industry
         laboratory safety protocols in Taiwan. We were also pleased to hear that the Taipei chapter
         already has 28 members, and that membership is expected to double in the coming
         months.

         I am wondering if you could edit your submission down to 300 words. This would allow
         enough space for three other submissions in the next issue. I would be happy to work with
         you on the revision. Please let me know if this will work for you.


         Thank you.

           My family and I had a pleasurable stay at your hotel. We
           enjoyed the activities you had scheduled and I would like to
           give my compliments to all the instructors. I had to skip the
           activity led by Ms. Okimoto, but my family told me they
           learned a lot from her. My daughter and I truly enjoyed
           learning how to make flower garlands, and my husband has
           already made some of the dishes he learned how to make in Mr.
           Anaya's class. Finally, my son and daughter both had great fun
           with Mr. Kalena. They are looking forward to putting his
           lessons to use when we travel on holiday to Morocco next year.

         Dear Valued Customers,
         After 25 years in business, Taste of Italy will be closing its doors April 23.
         During the week of April 17-23, please join us for a celebration of the store's
         history. All customers will receive a free cupcake with the purchase of any fresh
         bread or pastry item.
         Please keep an eye out for Taste of Italy pastry chef Salvator Ribisi. He will be
         opening his own bakery within the coming months, where customers will be able
         to order custom pastries and cakes for parties and weddings.
         It has been a pleasure to serve our wonderful Pineville City customers.
         Sincerely,

      I was sad that Taste of Italy closed-I had wanted them to make my wedding cake. So, I was
      excited when their former pastry chef opened Sweet Occasions in the Plaza Shopping Center. He
      made our cake, and it was perfect! Our guests kept commenting on how much they liked the cake.
      I would recommend Sweet Occasions to anyone.

                            Mr. Goodman is a painter and sculptor who lives in London.
              Conner Goodman's work will occupy our entire museum, with each museum hall
              representing a time period in English history, specifically focusing on the city of
              London. Mr. Goodman commemorates less commonly known moments in London's
              history taken from literature and film.
              Upon entering the museum, visitors will experience London as it was 2,000 years
              ago, in the time of the ancient Romans. Each succeeding gallery that visitors
              encounter will portray younger versions of the city up to present-day London.
              Mr. Goodman's art makes use of a range of media, including paint, video, and even
              recycled material. All pieces in this exhibition are Mr. Goodman's original creations.
              Tickets:
              Museum entrance: Â£15 per person
              Conner Goodman will discuss his exhibition at Cornwall Hall on Saturday, 9 May,
              at 6:00 PM. Tickets are Â£20 and half of all proceeds will be donated to the Historic
              Building Conservation Society. Please call (020) 7946 0609 for more information.

           Dear Mr. Goodman,
           I attended a recent event where you spoke about your work, and I later had the pleasure
           of visiting your exhibition.
           I am currently working on a novel set in England, mainly London, in the 17th century,
           and I am seeking an illustrator for this work. My publisher, Marson and Co. is
           prepared to offer generous compensation and has given me the discretion to select a
           collaborator. I feel that you would be an ideal creative partner.
           Would you consider working with me on this endeavor? Your agent informed me that
           you are currently in Paris. I will be there myself next week. Please feel free to contact
           me at finchg@libris.co.uk if you are available to meet.

                                     Hi, Roberto. I just got to my hotel from
                                     the airport but can't find the number for
                                     PXY Enterprises. Do you have it? I
                                     need to confirm today's client meeting.

                                      Roberto, 10:49 A.M.
                                      1-212-555-0158. Also, I talked to
                                      Marcia in finance: She said she hasn't
                                      seen the report from your last trip.



                                     Oh, that. I'll bring it to her when I get
                                     back tomorrow. Thanks for the
                                     reminder.

                                                                     (C)   Marcia will finish the report.

         I wanted to let everyone know that management has decided to postpone our annual
         company hiking trip, which is usually held in December. As all of you know, that is the
         busiest time of year for our car rental agency, and every year it is difficult to fit the trip
         into our schedule. The new date is 23 January. This should be more convenient for anyone
         who wants to go.
         If you would like to help plan the trip, please call Sandra Logan in Human Resources at
         extension 45. She needs help coordinating meals for the day. She has already confirmed
         that we will be hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing up to the Emerald Lakes.

               Thank you for giving me the great news. I'm glad to know we have so many
               subscribers returning for another season and that we also have an increase in new
               subscribers. Our advertising must be working!

               In answer to your question, we still haven't yet made a decision about the final show.
               I'm hoping plans to produce After the Sun will work out. It is an expensive production,
               and the budget is still an issue. If we can't afford to do it, we'll have to mail the tickets
               for the first four shows to subscribers in August as planned. Then we can send the
               tickets for the final show in September, after it has been chosen. I'll let you know by
               the end of next week whether we have decided to go ahead with After the Sun.

      Dear Mr. Guettera,

      Congratulations on your new position and thank you for sending the invoice for the
      products I ordered. When I spoke with Emilia Katzenbach, my previous contact at
      Restaurflex, she offered a discount on item RX1800, bringing the unit cost from 30 cents
      to 20 cents each. I understand that your prices have increased, but The Gramerty is a
      longtime customer. Could you please speak to her to confirm this and then send us an
      updated invoice?

      In addition, customers who ordered from our take-away menu have complained that the
      plastic lids on their containers did not close securely, and their soup leaked out. We never
      had this problem before our most recent order last December. I would like to return the
      remainder of this item, RX2333, and be reimbursed accordingly. Could you recommend a
      suitable replacement?

      Thank you,

      Chitan Mistry
      General Manager, The Gramerty

       Dear Ms. Lancer,
       I am a friend of Eric Raye, owner of The Shoe Horn, and he suggested that I contact you
       about a rental space in the Ocean Crest Mall. He told me about a great benefit that he
       received that is available to business owners like me. I own Edge Fashion and sell
       contemporary women's apparel. I have two retail locations in the nearby city of Hazelton,
       and I am considering expanding to Marlow Bay. If possible, I would like to be near my
       friend's store, but I do not want a space that is beside a restaurant or food service. A space
       on the boardwalk side that overlooks the beach would be ideal.
       Could you please send me a map of the mall showing any available spaces that might
       meet my needs? Also, could you provide information about the size of each space and
       rental fees?
       Thank you in advance,

      Dear Ms. Chalmers,

      My company is considering hiring Staff Celebrations for our employee picnic this summer,
      and the company gave us your name as a reference. If you have a moment, could you
      answer a few questions about their services? Specifically, we would like to know what the
      staff and location were like and whether the gift bag option is worth the additional cost. It
      would be very helpful if you could send us your impressions by the end of next week.

      Thank you in advance for your help.

            I am happy to provide you with some information about Staff Celebrations. We hired
            them for our tenth annual company picnic, which was held this past July. Over 200 of
            our employees and their families were in attendance. After looking into several options,
            we settled on Staff Celebrations to plan and host our event because they were highly
            recommended by several other companies in the area. We were delighted with the
            convenience of their service. All we had to do was make a few menu and game
            selections, and they did the rest. We chose to use one of their sites, which was as
            beautiful as promised. Despite uncomfortably high temperatures on the day of our event,
            the staff at Staff Celebrations remained cheerful and enthusiastic. We did not opt for the
            gift bag option, although I recall from our initial meeting that the choices for that
            seemed to be reasonably priced and of high quality. I highly recommend Staff
            Celebrations.

          Dear Mr. Saunders,

          I'd like to add another course to the list of suggestions. Having led various large-scale
          projects over the last five years, I have come to realize how helpful social media can be
          for supervisors and managers. Therefore, I suggest that you include among the new
          training courses one that focuses on social media and covers such topics as planning,
          executing, and assessing social media campaigns.

          Thank you and best wishes,

                          Supervisor Training Programme Now Available
    On Tuesday, HR director Mr. Rylan Saunders unveiled the new training programme for
    employees interested in becoming supervisors. The redesigned programme is the result of
    an inquiry carried out last January that looked into the opportunities available to employees
    wanting to move up the career ladder. It also included an analysis of the training, which
    determined that Vaughan Biotechnic's original programme was no longer effective. The
    improved programme includes courses that reflect today's complex work environment.
    Courses like Supervising Using Social Media help would-be managers learn how to utilize
    current tools to lead successful projects. Click the 'professional development' link for more

     I was at Feddere Electronics yesterday. I tried out the Movie Stream projector that you
     suggested we use during our presentations at next week's investors meeting in Warsaw. I
     did like that the device is small enough to fit in my carry-on baggage and that it can
     project images onto any surface. I also like that it can stream material from the Internet
     in any location that has a wireless Internet connection. Unfortunately, if you place the
     device more than a meter away from the wall, the image becomes dim and blurred. That
     means that the images we want to show would not be large enough for our audience to
     see.

     Thanks for your suggestion, but even at its bargain price, I don't think that this
     projector will suit our needs. For our upcoming trip, I think we should stick with what
                                                                                                               I

      Hello, Ms. Brown. Thank you for contacting Customer Service. How may I help you?
      Kim Brown: 4:26 P.M.
      I ordered three packages of ink on May 4. I received a confirmation e-mail stating that the order was
      shipped on May 8 and would arrive by May 12, but the package has not arrived.
      Agent Mark Smalls: 4:28 P.M.
      Sorry to hear that. Give me a moment while I check. Do you have your order number?
      Kim Brown: 4:32 P.M.
      Sure. It's order JX43125.
      Agent Mark Smalls: 4:35 P.M.
      OK. One moment.
      Agent Mark Smalls: 4:38 P.M.
      Ms. Brown, our tracking system indicates that the package arrived on May 10. Can you confirm your
      shipping address is 15 Walters Court, Boca Raton, FL 33431?
      Kim Brown: 4:41 P.M.
      Yes, that's correct.
      Agent Mark Smalls: 4:42 P.M.
      Is it possible that a neighbor picked it up?
      Kim Brown: 4:43 P.M.
      I really don't think so. I know my neighbors, and it's been over a week now.
      Agent Marie Smalls: 4:45 P.M.
      I see. Well, I'm very sorry your package seems to have been lost. Would you like us to send you a
      replacement? The order should arrive by May 27.
      Kim Brown: 4:46 P.M.
      I need the ink right away. Would you be able to expedite shipping and handling?
      Agent Mark Smalls: 4:50 P.M.
      With express delivery, your order would arrive on May 24. Since your original order was standard
      delivery, express delivery would be an additional $15.
      Kim Brown: 4:51 P.M.
      In that case, please just refund my order.
      Agent Mark Smalls: 4:52 P.M.
      Certainly. I will refund the original purchase price and delivery charge to your credit card.

                   Brossel Mini Sofa

      Sales team members,
      I have learned that the information sheet on the new Brossel Mini Sofa has been
      updated by the manufacturer, and I'm writing to provide you with the revised details.
      The dimensions should be as follows: width 199 cm, depth 97 cm, and height 64 cm.
      There are also some upholstery options not listed in the earlier version of the
      information: Cornflower Blue and Brown Leaf Print. The throw pillows are available in
      an additional 60-cm size. Finally, the price of the sofa has changed to $549.
      I will supply you with a corrected version of the sheet soon but wanted you to be aware
      of the changes now, since the new item will be available within the next few days, for
      our annual special sale.

      Regards,

      Natalia Beckley

    Product: Brossel Mini Sofa

    I purchased a new Brossel Mini Sofa during last week's big sale
    at Lewiston's Fine Furnishings, and I love it so far. It's stylish
    and comfortable, and the leaf print looks great in my study.
    There was only one minor problem in the purchasing process. The
    salesperson consulted his product information and stated that the
    piece was 203 cm wide. I was concerned that it might be too wide.
    As I weighed my options, though, the sales manager happened to
    pass by. Fortunately, she corrected the error by providing
    information from an updated sales sheet. Despite this small slip,
    I highly recommend both the sofa and the store.
