           Date:           7 January

           Dear Mr. Kim,

           Because of a maintenance project, the water to Jigye Apartments will be turned off for
           several hours next Wednesday, 12 January. The interruption will begin at 11:00 A.M.
           Water service will be restored by 5:00 P.M. Please inform all of your building's tenants
           in advance about the interruption, as well as these general guidelines:

           1. After the water is turned back on, air in the pipes may cause sudden bursts of water.
           You can fix this problem by running water slowly at first.

           2. For any other issues that occur after water service is returned, call our Customer
           Service desk at the number listed on ou~ Web site for your specific area.

           3. Maintenance workers do their best to work quickly and finish as scheduled.

           This service interruption is necessary to improve the quality of your water service in the
           future. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

           Best regards,

      Gabriel Li (9:10 A.M.)       Good morning, everyone. I want to remind you that Larkin Landscaping
                                   will be here at Derryco tomorrow morning to remove the trees from
                                   the front parking area. My workers will block off the area before the
                                   contractor arrives, so you and your staff should plan to find parking
                                   elsewhere or use public transit.

      Ava Abberton (9:11 A.M.)     I have a client, Jan McGonagle, who will be driving in from Belfast to
                                   meet with me at 10:00 A.M. What should I tell her? Can she contact
                                   the facilities department?

      Martin Beattie (9:12 A.M.)   There's heavy rain in the forecast. Are you sure the tree work will go
                                   forward?

      Gabriel Li (9:13 A.M.)       Yes, give Ms. McGonagle my mobile phone number and have her
                                   call me when she arrives. I will direct her around the back. The spots
                                   there will be reserved for visitors only.

      Gabriel Li (9:14 A.M.)       And yes, Larkin assured me the crew comes out rain or shine.

      Daniel Deegan (9:15A.M.) Remember, too, that we can approve team members to work from
                               home tomorrow. Just make sure that all conference calls are listed
                               on the master schedule on the intranet.

      Gabriel Li (9:16 A.M.)       Right. Thank you, all.                                                        ,.._

        We are pleased to announce that our latest design, the Suppliss Seat, will be
        introduced on Honshu Express's Tokyo-Osaka service route, which is scheduled to
        debut soon. Since last February, our design team has worked closely with Honshu
        Express to produce a comfortab le seat that meets the most stringent safety standards.
        Like all our products, it is made of lightweight yet durable materials, resulting in
        significant fuel-cost savings over time. The prototype for the Suppliss Seat has received
        high marks from designers and was nominated for a Henry Design Award in January.

     Hello, Joseph,
     I hope that you are well. Many thanks for your quick turnaround since we tested the
     product with a small group of consumers last month. The features your team added to
     the initial design are perfect, particularly the optional footrests. We were also impressed
     with the overall style and noticed how well the seats fit in with the contemporary look of
     our air carrier interiors.
     By the way, the Tokyo-Osaka service route will go operational at the end of April. I'll
     send you the details next week so that you can post them on your Web site.
     Thanks again,

                        I @List of products
        Dear Ms. Goncalves:

        As owner of Sabatini Leather Goods, I would like to express interest in a short-term
        leasing opportunity at La Gardina Mall.

        Sabatini Leather Goods is a small company that manufactures and sells souvenir
        handbags and wallets. Our high-quality leather products are imprinted with the name of
        the tourist destination where they are sold. I have attached some images of our
        best-selling items from our most recent temporary shop in Glastonbury, where we had
        our best sales performance in the company's history. We have sold our products in
        24 different locations so far, all with great success.

        We have been looking for a place in Bay Shore for a while, and La Gardina Mall seems
        to be a good fit. We would like a space of about 150 square meters for a three-month
        period over the summer tourism season. Could you please call me at 555-01 25 so that
        we can discuss this matter further?

        Respectfully,

        Marco Sabatini

       I regret to inform you that Tyche Fine Carpets, the supplier we selected for the carpets in
       The Pavel Hotel's lobby and lo unge areas, will not have our chosen pattern available until
       after the hotel's anticipated opening date of March 1. Attached are photographs of several
       alternative selections that I believe will work well with the decor. They are all made of the
       same material as the previous selection, and the prices are comparable. With the grand
       opening less than a month away, I need a decision from you as soon as possible. Even
       with this last-minute change, I am certain that The Pavel Hotel will provide the ambience
       we have set out to create.

       Thank you,

       Miles Sorrell

                                  opening of The Pavel Hotel in downtown
                                  Centerville, between the library and the
                                  visitors center. Once the city 's courthouse and
                                  Ms. Simpson's workplace, the existing
                                  structure had been vacant for the past nine
                                  years. Now the space boasts 34 elegant rooms,
                                  an inviting lounge with a fireplace, and a
                                  gorgeous lobby. An on-site cafe is expected to
                                  open next month. The interior, designed by
                                  Miles Sorrell, retains the old features of the
                                  building, such as expansive windows and high
                                  ceilings, while creating a warm and inviting
                                  space.

               Subject:    Upcoming enhancements to our shuttle bus system
               In direct response to your helpful feedback, we would like to announce a
               number of improvements to the shuttle system that connects the Optieris
               campus with the Morbrook and Nesse train stations. The following
               changes will go into effect on January 2:
               (1) A third bus will be added to our fleet to increase service frequency as
               well as capacity in case one bus is ever down for maintenance. Buses will
               now run every 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes.
               (2) A second campus stop will be added. Besides the current stop at the
               main administration building on the east side of the Optieris campus,
               there will be a second stop to better accommodate all our staff.
               (3) A service will be added in the evening. It will depart the Optieris
               campus 30 minutes later than the current last service of the day.
               Thanks again for your input. For the sake of our environment, we are
               proud to facilitate your use of public transportation by making our shuttle
               bus service more convenient than ever.

     September 18
     I used Bright Now Home's new in-store customer pickup for the first time this week. The
     service was a big time-saver because my order was ready for me when I got to the store.
     Since I had already paid online, I didn 't have to wait in the regular line in the store.
     Unfortunately, I didn ' t double-check my order before I left the store. When I arrived at
     the house I was working on, I realized I had received only one of the two gallons of
     BN-101 paint I had ordered . I called the store immediately, and the manager arranged for
     me to pick up the missing gallon of paint at the location closest to where I was working.
     Also, he gave me my money back for both gallons. I will definitely use this service again!

                 Babson Vehicles Ltd. Enthusiastically Implements Deluxident's Newest Product
                OTTAWA (10 June)-Babson Vehicles Ltd., a leading Canadian manufacturer, has
                just adopted a new fingerprint entry system aimed at improving company security.
                Created by Icelandic firm Deluxident, the system enables employees to enter campus
                buildings simply by scanning their fingerprints.

                According to Babson's CEO Daniel Deems, Deluxident's fingerprint-scanning system
                is a significant improvement over other security products the company has tried in
                the past.

                "Deluxident's fingerprint scanner has been a tremendous asset. In the past, we always
                accessed our buildings by using photographic and electronic identification badges,"
                said Deems. "Producing and replacing lost badges, however, was expensive. In
                addition, they posed a significant security threat. Employees sometimes forgot their
                badges, adding to traffic through our security office. All in all, the badges were costly
                and risky."

                For the past decade, Deluxident has been offering high-tech workplace solutions with
                its innovative digital products. Headquartered in Reykjavik, Deluxident delivers
                items worldwide and offers 24-hour technical assistance by telephone. For further
                details about the new fingerprint-scanning entry system, visit www.deluxident.is.




161. What is implied about Mr. Deems?                          163. What is true about Deluxident?
     (A)   He oversees multiple buildings.                           (A)   It   ships its products internationally.
     (B)   He makes frequent trips abroad.                           (B)   It   is based in Canada.

                  Dear Mr. Donnell,

                  After searching through Lewis and Clark County's public property tax records online,
                  I discovered that you are the owner of the building that was once a general store on
                  the corner of Waller Avenue and Main Street. As far as I can tell, the building h as
                  been boarded up and unoccupied for quite a few years. - [l] - . I would like to know
                  if you would be interested in selling it.

                  I have been planning to open a cafe in the area, and I believe that with some modest
                  improvements, your building could be the perfect location. I would want to keep as
                  much of the original structure intact as possible. - [2] - . Any modifications would
                  be minor.

                  I realize there are other buildings for sale in the business district, but they do not

          Dear Colleagues,

          This is a reminder that Contiera Corporation's spring management meeting is scheduled
          for 9 A.M. tomorrow. The final agenda is attached. Please note that I have added an
          item to the original meeting agenda. Mai Tran, our publications supervisor, wants to
          update everyone on this season's product line. She should not take more than twenty
          minutes.

          To prepare for the meeting, please review our most recent marketing plan so that we all
          have a clear idea of our goals for the quarter. It would also help if each of you brought
          copies of your latest budget report and projected cost estimates for next quarter.

          I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

          Fiona Watson

         such a glowing referral on my behalf.

         Mr. Nirmal, Neela's chief recruiting officer, expressed his admiration for the television
         commercials I produced for Delhi Works, but he explained that his company in fact needs
         someone who can also create Web content and applications. I was therefore not offered the
         position.

      Dear Ms. Sohn,                                                                               ~

      As you know, competition for use of the printers has been causing a great deal of delay
      for members of the legal department. Everyone has had to wait to print documents at some
      point. Some of us have had to start coming to work earlier, and others are staying late.
      This is having a negative impact on our productivity and morale.

      We could improve the situation for the remainder of the year by posting a sign-up sheet
      next to the printers. To be fair, each employee should sign up for only two fifteen-minute
      blocks per day. We could also reserve the lunch hour for unscheduled printing. And we
      should consider discontinuing the use of color printers until the situation is under
      control-color printing is up to five times as expensive as black-and-white printing. Let
      me know what you think.

      Regards,

              Subject:   Printer use
              We have purchased two new printers, a multicolor UX212 and a
              black-and-white UY120 Truzynx. Unfortunately, they will not be arriving
              until December 18. In the meantime, please continue to schedule your
              printer-use times using the online link I e-mailed you on November 10.
              Using this document, you may reserve up to two fifteen-minute printing
              periods per day. Please do not schedule consecutive sessions, and
              remember that we have set aside time both in the morning and in the
              afternoon for emergency printing. Also, please use the color printers only
              when absolutely necessary. We have been purchasing more color ink than
              usual because staff members are using the color printers for scanning and
              printing when the black-and-white printers are in use.

     Dear Mr. Gosnell,


     Below are some preliminary conclusions and recommendations based on our analysis of the

     design of the Brookside Visitors Bureau Web site.


     First, the site is not as ------- as it should be. We recommend updating its appearance and adding
                                143.
     information that meets the demands of today's tourists. Note also that your organization's logo is

     not used consistently------- your Web site.
                           144.

     You should also consider supplementing the imagery used to promote the city. -1-45:. We

     therefore recommend uploading some professionally made videos featuring the various

     attractions Brookside has to offer. -------, we suggest adding a page to the Web site that allows
                                          146.
     residents and visitors to upload their own photos and videos of city attractions.


     Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the next steps .

            Subject:   Chanti Workspaces
            Date:      February 11
            In a special partnership with Chanti Workspaces, five standing desks will
            be available to employees on a trial basis from February 20 to March 15.
            Standing desks allow you to stand comfortably while working. We will use
            the new Chanti B45 model, which is adjustable, so you can alternate
            between sitting and standing at the perfect height for you. Research
            suggests that standing desks can negate some of the harmful physical
            effects of sitting too much. They may also improve mood and overall
            health. Those wishing to take advantage of this opportunity should contact
            me. If we have more interest than desks, the recipients will be those who
            contact me first . Those using the desks will be asked to take a survey
            about their experience to help us determine whether we should make
            standing desks available to all employees.

        a delay caused by some unexpected construction in Terminal A. I will e-mail you more
        details later this week, along with a request that you join us here. It would be great to
        have someone attend from the corporate office.

        As I have planned, we will celebrate our relocation with a month of special deals on all
        car rentals . I have also arranged for us to partner with Moonray Airways for special flight
        and car travel packages. Although we expect many of our customers will continue to be
        business travelers, we hope to attract tourists, too.

        I hope to see you next month .

        Bon-Hwa Oh

       Dennis:

       The heads of accounting and sales have chosen the finalists for the job openings in their
       departments here at Plumsted Aynes. Susan Tsai would like to invite Marco Garcia and
       Danielle Jenkins to return for second interviews for the accounting position, and Rajesh
       Kapoor wants to invite Melanie Yu for a second interview for the medical sales position.

       I would like you to call the finalists, schedule interviews with them, and then make lunch
       arrangements accordingly. Keep in mind that Susan will be out of the office next week for
       a conference.

       Thank you for your assistance with this search so far. I'm especially grateful that you were
       able to work on a short deadline when I asked you to set up the initial interviews.

       Regards,

       I called the three finalists. As it turns out, this afternoon Melanie Yu accepted a job offer
       with another pharmaceutical firm-our competitor Granquist. I informed Rajesh about this
       development and he said he hopes to find a suitable replacement.

       I have confirmed an interview for Mr. Garcia on Tuesday, November 20. I also made
       arrangements with our regular catering company for lunch here. Unfortunately, Ms. Jenkins
       was recently hospitalized, so I'm leaving any further decision about her interview with
       you.

             Hi, Kate,

             The next focus group to test the new fruit-flavored beverage ideas will be held on
             February 1 in the Greenville office. Mari Kobayashi will be leading it.

             Please design a questionnaire to collect the group's feedback using the one you created
             last month as a template and send it over to Mari. After the focus group takes place,
             please tally the results in the form of a chart. I need to incorporate this information into
             my monthly report to the chief marketing officer.

             Thanks,

             Hi, Daniel,

             According to Mari Kobayashi, 25 of the 30 registered participants for Greenville took
             the taste test and completed the questionnaire. The results are mostly in line with the
             results from last month's focus group. However, Mari did note that the Greenville

      I stayed at the Zaboka Guesthouse for three nights in April. There are several other
      hotels in the area, but in my view, this is certainly the nicest option within the
      pr ice range. The lively courtyard and huge communal kitchen both present a great
      environment for meeting other guests. That was without a doubt my favorite aspect.
      If you plan to ar rive in the even ing, make sure you get the code to enter into the
      electronic keypad at the door, as the street level entrance is locked after 7 P.M . This
      isn't something I was made aware of, so I had to wait a short wh il e to be let in .
      Other than that, I rea lly e njoyed my stay!                                                          -

        Dear Customers:

        For many years, we at Star Designs have strived to offer quality apparel at competitive
        prices. Unfortunately, as a quick glance at our online store shows, we have been forced
        to increase our prices recently. Every effort has been made to avoid this, but because
        of the growing costs of cotton and most fabrics that we use to sew our colorful shirts
        and formal wear, we could no longer afford to maintain our prices. However, we will
        continue to provide the excellent quality and customer-oriented approach that you
        have come to appreciate with Star Designs.

        Thank you for your understanding and your continued loyalty!

       am overseeing that includes the manuscript due dates as well as other pertinent

       Ian Pressler has been working closely with me for the past few months on travel and
       finance titles, so he is well aware of the ongoing projects in this area and will see that
       things go smoothly. We had a lunch meeting yesterday at the new restaurant near
       Anderson Market to go over them . - [3] - . Ian will make certain the appropriate
       e-mail reminders are sent out to the authors whose projects are nearing completion . I
       will have limited Internet access while traveling, but I will respond to messages as
       quickly as possible. - [4] - .

       Kind regards ,

                                                                                                          -
                                    for improving the inspection process for dental offices?

      Suzanne Parrin (9:31 A.M.)    There is too much paperwork. Perhaps inspectors could
                                    complete forms electronically.

      Zachary Qian (9:32 A.M.)      Great idea. That would eliminate paper completely.

      lchiro Watanabe (9:33 A.M.)   That's an effective way for us to save time and money, but how
                                    do we transition from using the current forms to electronic
                                    ones? How would inspectors be trained?

      Suzanne Parrin (9:35 A.M.)    What if inspectors continue to use paper forms while they're
                                    learning how to use the new electronic version?

      Zachary Qian (9:36 A.M.)      That way, they would gain some experience with the electronic
                                    forms. And maybe we could hire instructors to train our
                                    inspectors so they're ready for the transition.

      Suzanne Parrin (9:38 A.M.)    Exactly. We could hold the training sessions here at the Labor
                                    Department.

      lchiro Watanabe (9:40 A.M.)   Great. I'll propose these ideas at the meeting.

          Re:     Wellness Classes

          In the interest of promoting a healthy and productive workforce, Lellar
          Manufacturing will begin offering monthly wellness classes. While
          participation is not required, we do hope that everyone will take
          advantage of this opportunity. Part- and full-time regular employees are
          eligible for these classes at no cost. All other workers and trainees will be
          required to pay a small enrollment fee.
          Local nurses from Union City Hospital will run the classes on-site, so you
          do not have to travel anywhere. Classes will be held the first Friday
          morning of each month, and the class topics will change each month. The
          class topics in order, starting in September and going through December,
          will be as follows: Easy Stretching, Good Food Choices, Tips for Better
          Sleep, and Starting an Exercise Group.
          Supervisor approval is necessary. The first step is to complete a class
          request form and send it to the Benefits Department. If you have any
          questions, contact our benefits counselors Don Herrell at ext. 249 or Leah
          Katzen at ext. 199.

        Millway Road Hotel
        Review posted by Mi-Yeon Ko
        I recently attended a small conference at the Millway Road Hotel, which opened
        in June. As a computer technician, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had
        such up-to-date facilities. Both my room and the meeting room had more than
        enough electrical outlets to plug in equipment and charge mobile phones and
        computers. The complimentary wireless Internet service was easy to access.
        On top of that, the food was delicious and the guest rooms were beautiful.
                                                                                                            -   T

        Dear Staff,

        Throughout November, we will be holding mandatory training sessions for two of our
        major software products.

        Training in the Abacus Deepthink software will be required for all staff members and
        can be completed in a single online session. Several possible session times are available.
        The software has gone through several changes recently, so even longtime users must
        attend.

        The Optisafe software training will be offered in person and is a requirement only for
        Drug Safety department members. This past year, major upgrades have been made to the
        software, and all department staff will need to learn how to use its new capabilities.

        Please look over the attached schedule and go to the company training Web site to sign
        up.

        Thank you,

        Leila Hedlund

                                   (April 27)-According to a recent government
                                   report, the demand for diesel mechanics is
                                   expected to increase by 15 percent in the next
                                   ten years. There is a growing need for diesel
                                   mechanics in the construction, oil, and power
                                   industries. Most of the positions pay very well
                                   and only require a high school diploma and
                                   technical training. Bower Technical Institute
                                   in Centerville provides that training.

                                   diesel mechanic classes that focus on power
                                   trains and engine management systems. Later,
                                   guest students can participate in hands-on
                                   sessions to experience some of the day-to-day
                                   tasks involved in the field .
                                   The event is free, but space is limited.
                                   Participants must have a high school diploma
                                   or equivalent credential. E-mail Taneisha Hill

      As you may have heard, Jonah Katzberg is leaving at the end of the month for a new job
      in Vancouver. I know that his workplace dedication and his sense of humor will be missed
      by all. Let's say goodbye and offer our best wishes at noon tomorrow in the conference
      room. Sandwiches, along with a cake and assorted beverages, will be served. We would
      like this to be a surprise, so please don 't mention anything to Jonah. No one is expected to
      buy a gift, but do bring your best stories and, if you have any snapshots that really capture
      the times we shared together over the years, please forward them to me. I'm creating a
      short slideshow for us all to enjoy.

            find an address online.

            Jennifer Bech [9:39 A.M.]
            Yes, but it has been years . I think there's a new editor now. Let me check.

            Shari Shu [9:40 A.M.]
            We wrote a press release that we want to e-mail to various news outlets tomorrow.

            Jennifer Bech [9:44 A.M.]
            Yes, there's a new editor: Dale Korman . I don't have his e-mail address, but from
            the old contacts I have, it looks like they all use the same naming convention. I'd try
            d.korman@yakimanews.com. That's my best guess.

       From:         Carol Yates
       Subject:      CCS Conference
       Date:         1 June
       Attachment:   @Conference schedule

       Dear Staff,

       The 12th annual conference of the Caribbean Culinary Society (CCS) will take place
       here in Jamaica from 16 to 20 July. I have received a request from Chef Regina Tufton,
       chair of the organising committee, to conduct two workshops. It is an honour to be
       invited by such an accomplished culinary expert, someone who is also the author of five
       cookbooks on Caribbean cuisine. More importantly, it is a wonderful opportunity for
       Yates Restaurant to showcase some of its award-winning delicacies.

       The first workshop will focus on cooking techniques inspired by French cuisine. As
       Assistant Chef Duane Munroe has distinguished himself in this regard, I have asked
       him to help me with this presentation. The second workshop will address the challenges
       and rewards of running a food establishment. Since Zavia Pinnock has been doing an
       outstanding job of managing our restaurant, I have requested her input on the topic.

       I encourage each of you to attend one or more conference sessions. Of course, the
       restaurant must remain open and be well staffed during the conference period. So that I
       can be sure that we have enough staff on hand during the period of the conference,
       please let me know by 21 June the day(s) and time(s) of the session(s) you wish to
       attend. For your convenience, a copy of the conference schedule is attached.

       Sincerely,

       Carol Yates

           You may remember that we recently discussed ideas for an outing for the employees and
           their families. I think the best idea is to go to a baseball game. I have always enjoyed
           taking my family to see the Billington Buffaloes, our local team. You might have noticed
           that several of the photos in my office were taken at the stadium! And since I usually see
           other staff members at the games, I think this will appeal to most of our group.

           Could you please set this up for June 28? I believe it can all be done online if you prefer.
           By my calculations, we will need 45 tickets in total, but please double-check this number.
           Also, I would like food to be provided. Let's limit our cost to under $20 per person and
           make sure the seating is covered just in case the weather is poor. Please send me the
           details as soon as the tickets are purchased.

      part of a unique summer education programme for teenagers. Along with having the same
      skills required by the regular position, these special instructors will be required to implement
      a curriculum designed and supervised by the Ontario Foundation for Teaching and Learning.
      The selected candidates will first complete a paid monthlong training course during May.
      They must be available to work Tuesday evenings and Wednesday evenings from June 1
      through the end of the summer.
      Candidates must have a minimum of six months of teaching experience and hold cutTent

            January 3

            Dear District Council Members,

            My firm is interested in purchasing the building at 1210 Prince Street. Since this
            property has been on the market for almost five years, it has fallen into disrepair.
            Regal Properties is willing to invest what is necessary to update the building.

            In addition, we would like to convert three of the apartment units on the ground
            floor facing the street into space for businesses. However, the property is zoned only
            for residential use. Would you consider rezoning the property to allow for mixed
            residential and business use?

            Sincerely,

            Community resident and building manager Carla Phillips spoke to express
            opposition to the rezoning of 1210 Prince Street under consideration by the
            council. Ms. Phillips is concerned that the increased pedestrian and vehicular
            traffic will make the street too crowded. She thinks it will also be difficult for
            residents of her building, Lighthouse Apartments, located at 1208 Prince Street,
            to park in the neighborhood.
            The council agreed to consider the zoning issue at their February monthly
            meeting to give additional residents on Prince Street an opportunity to voice
            their opinions.

       I am reaching out to you to determine when we can meet. Since news about the creation
       of our Business Alliance is generating interest within the community, it is time to create
       some written materials to promote ourselves.

       I would like to spend time at our meeting formulating an action plan for soliciting
       members. I have attached a draft agenda. It should not take long to coordinate our
       assignments for speaking to local business owners, but we could probably save meeting
       time by doing this online before the meeting.

       Please send me an e-mail with your availability for the next few weeks. I understand that
       Sasha Zimmer is out of town until early July, but I still hope we can find a meeting date
       and time that will work for everyone.

                            Finalized organizational meeting
       Attachment: 11 lID Final agenda

        Thanks to everyone for your feedback. The final agenda is attached. We have confirmed         LJ
        the workshop for June 28 at the Linton Community Library. The library opens at
        10:00 A.M. and staff will be on hand to help set up the room .

        I'd like to stress the importance of sticking to the agenda because our time together is
        limited. Those meeting participants who would like to discuss any topics further can
        perhaps enjoy some lunch after the meeting. I will plan to go to Devon's Sandwich Shop,
        which is just one block south of the library. All are welcome to join me.

      Dear Staff,

      Please note that the office will be closed again on Monday because the contractor needs
      more time than initially anticipated to complete the floor installation. I will update you on
      the progress of the project as details become available. While at home, though, continue to
      follow up on project leads and to support your customer accounts.

      Obviously, we will have to postpone the meeting scheduled for Monday until later in the
      week. On that occasion we will go over our earnings and revenue of the previous quarter.
      I have attached the relevant information so that you can review it ahead of time.
      Additionally, we will be looking at some recent trends in sustainable building design and
      construction.

      Finally, I apologize for the disruption this renovation project has caused. Then again, I
      hope you have been seizing this opportunity to find new ways to work effectively and to
      enjoy work-life balance.

      Best regards,

        I'm writing on behalf of the Talvix Energy Professionals Partnership (TEPP). The TEPP
        pairs young adults considering careers in the energy sector with engineers and executives
        from Talvix. Each quarter we arrange an educational trip for the program participants.

        On 12 October we are planning for a group of six mentors and twelve mentees to visit the
        Morlen Museum. We plan to visit the Geology Lab to examine the origins of fossil fuels.
        We believe an in-depth tour would be quite beneficial to the mentees . Would you be able
        to provide us with a tour of the lab? If so, what would be the cost in addition to the ticket
        price? We also want to spend time at the special exhibit.

        Thank you in advance for your assistance.

        Thank you for promptly returning the paperwork relevant to your internship. You will
        receive your intern packet within a week.

        As for your inquiry about housing, I appreciate your concern that the two-hour train ride
        from London to your assigned location makes for an arduous daily commute. Regrettably,
        HJP does not provide accommodations for interns. I suggest that you contact Mr. Daniel
        Anders who is in charge of the mentorship program in our Bristol office. He has lived in
        the city for many years and presumably will have some advice about housing options
        there. Good luck, and I hope you will enjoy working at HJP.

        Eurojitl is celebrating 125 years of providing quality glass containers to Italy and beyond!
        Glass bottles and jars have long been the standard for beautiful, functional containers.
        Consider all the desirable attributes of this useful material.

        1. Neutrality           Glass containers do not interact with the products they hold. Glass
                                has no flavor or odor and is thus ideal for storing food or personal
                                care products.
        2. Impermeability       Glass is impermeable to air and water. Products stored in glass
                                containers are well protected and remain fresh longer.
        3. Environmentally Glass is made of sand, limestone, and soda ash-natural ingredients
          Responsible      that do not harm the Earth. Glass can be reused and recycled.
        4. Convenience          Glass is easy to clean and dishwasher safe.
        5. Style                Glass has endless design possibilities. Choose from our catalog or
                                work with our Euroful designers who can assist you in customizing
                                a vessel for your product.

        Dear Mr. Luzzatto:

        Thank you for your call during which you went over the details of the design of the
        jars with us. The containers are quite unique and will certainly make Bivilla's cosmetic
        products stand out from those of our competitors.

        After talking with my team, I have one more question. We ship throughout Europe and
        occasionally to Asia. Do you have recommendations regarding packing methods and
        filling materials for cases in which the jars are packaged? We are looking for a filling
        material that offers substantial protection for our product, but does minimal damage, if
        any, to the surroundings.

        Best regards,

        Birgit Villadsen

                    Tips for shipping products in glass containers
                    Overpackfog is the safest method of transporting delicate items.
                    Overpacking simply means packing the box containing the product
                    inside another larger box. An absorbent filling material is inserted
                    between the two boxes, cushioning the smaller box from vibrations
                    and movement during transit. Depending on your specific needs,
                    any of the following materials could be used as filler.

                    Filler                            Protection         Earth friendly

        venue for your reception, banquet, or business meeting. Away from the hustle and
        bustle of the city, it is surrounded by lush gardens featuring a variety of beautiful

        space, the Bougainvillea Room, is perfect for up to 300 guests. For business meetings,
        the Tamarind Room can accommodate up to 50 guests, while the Waterfall Room,
        slightly larger, seats up to 80 people. Our two business meeting spaces are outfitted
        with the latest technology to support productive and efficient meetings.
        Our elegant restaurant, the Candlewood Tree, offers an ample menu that takes into
        account many dietary restrictions and preferences. Plan ahead to join us on July 10

      Hello, Tanika,                                                                               ~

      I visited Elvinna's and looked at the space that you suggested might be right for our
      company's anniversary celebration. Their catering menu would suit the various preferences
      of our expected guests, now numbering over 250. Currently the room is available on two
      Saturdays, 15 July and 5 August; it is also available on Wednesday, 23 August. Note that
      this last date would qualify for a nice discount.

      Let me know if I have your approval to book this room. We need to make a decision
      quickly before other parties reserve those dates. I'll be in touch soon about rescheduling
      the awards ceremony in May.

                To:        All Staff
                From:      Donaldo Mata, Facilities Supervisor
                Date:      July 22
                Subject:   Drilling process
               As I reported at last week's staff meeting, we are now in the final planning
               stages for the new addition to our headquarters building. - [1] - . As part
               of the process, contractors will be drilling holes tomorrow in the north,
               east, and west sides of the building to do structural analysis. - [2] - . The
               drilling is expected to take several hours, and the work will be very noisy.
               I realize that this type of noise can be very distracting to employees who
               are trying to speak with customers or conduct meetings. - [3] -. I have
               requested that the contractors begin drilling on the east side, closest to the
               Customer Service Office, so that drilling can be finished before peak
               service hours. Please keep windows on all sides of the building shut to
               minimize the noise and prevent any exhaust fumes from the drilling rig
               from entering the building.
               - [4] - . I will be here all day supervising the process and will be
               available to answer any questions. I sincerely apologize for the
               inconvenience.

            Dear Visitors:

            Heylin Park is a rugged wilderness site. Our trails are grassy and unpaved, and many
            contain protruding tree roots, rocks, and stumps. Licensed park rangers will remove
            fallen debris if a trail becomes impassable, but in order to maintain a healthy habitat
            for wildlife, the land is otherwise kept in its natural state. To support our efforts,
            we ask that you please take nothing home with you aside from photographs and
            memories. Please allow the flowers to grow wild and leave sticks and stones where
            they are.

            If you would like to learn about the different trees, shrubs, and flowers growing in
            our park, you can join a free ranger-guided hike. These are held every Saturday from
            2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Just add your name to the sign-up sheet at the check-in kiosk,
            located near the park entrance.

            Thank you and enjoy your hike!

            Sincerely,

            Heylin Park Management

                 Norden City, AZ 86310

                 Dear Mr. Campbell,

                 I appreciate the Norden Water Commission's interest in my serving as a member of
                 your board of directors. As we discussed, I am currently unable to assume any
                 additional responsibilities. - [1] - . However, I would like to take this opportunity
                 to voice my support for Ms. Lauren Birrell to serve as a board member.

                 Ms. Birrell, the Director of Development at Harding Environmental Group, began
                 her career here as a water analyst. She was quickly promoted to multiple supervisory
                 roles as her expert knowledge and skills became apparent. - [2] - . For example, a
                 recent research study led by Ms. Birrell found deficiencies with Norden City's water
                 pumping system. - [3] - . She provided guidance on necessary upgrades in a timely
                 and cost-effective manner. The upgraded system, which requires much less
                 maintenance, has saved Norden City thousands of dollars over the past five years.

                 Additionally, Ms. Birrell has built strong relationships with the Great Valley
                 Watershed, the Norden Department of Environmental Protection, and other
                 government agencies. - [4] - . Ms. Birrell would be an invaluable contributor to
                 your organization.

                 Should you have any questions, please contact me directly at 928-555-0176.

      Since you were away last week, you might not yet know all the details of the situation
      with the Web site. Shannon Gehring, our Web designer, was in the middle of revising the
      site when a severe thunderstorm hit our area. Our servers were struck by lightning and
      sustained some damage. While they were being repaired, the museum 's Web site was down
      for two days.

      I know you are planning to send an e-mail to members today, asking them to help us meet
      a fund-raising goal by 30 June, the end of our fiscal year. Our site is back online now, and
      includes a new comment page that can be used for this fund-raising event. Please let me
      know if you need additional information.

        Tam such a hig fan of the Knight Museum! Thave heen taking advantage of some of
        the museum's wonderful programs. The recent series of watercolor painting classes
        with local artist Leroy Davis was terrific. This experience with watercolors will help
        me appreciate the museum's current exhibition of Japanese watercolor paintings even
        more; I'm looking forward to taking a tour of the exhibition next week.
        1 already contribute as a museum member, but 1 just made an additional donation
        online today after I received a fund-raising e-mail from the museum's director. It
        was easy to access the Web site, although I had trouble last week. I hope others
        will support the museum by contributing before the 30 June deadline. The Knight
        Museum's programming is worth it.

           Dear Ms. Babin,

           I'm writing to inform you of several problems regarding my recent order. I have been
           buying items from your company for years, and my previous orders have never had an
           error. Therefore, I was very surprised when my latest order arrived. First, the shipment
           contained only two packs of T-shirts, which is not the amount listed on the invoice. I
           saw the note about the long-sleeved shirts, but there was no note about the T-shirts.

           Additionally, the price for item number 61 is listed in your catalog and on your Web
           site as $50 per pack, but that was not what I was charged. Can you please look into this
           matter and give me a call? You can reach me at +64 04 455 5212.

           Thanks in advance,

             Yes, I will be going to the cardiology conference, and I am looking forward to it.
             Unfortunately, I will not be able to travel there with you because I am seeing patients
             unti l 3 P.M. on 5 August. I will have to miss the first day's sessions, but I will be on-site
             that evening and for the next two days .

             Maybe we can have dinner together one evening? Evrim Turgut was telling me about
             your research together into diagnostic imaging technologies, and I would love the
             chance to discuss it with you.

             Let me know when you will be free.

      Dear Mr. Freel,

      It was a pleasure meeting with you earlier this week at Jam Cafe to talk about the design
      for the Images of Success mural project. I hadn't been to Jam Cafe since it reopened, and
      it was great to see the finished renovations . In fact, the owner of the cafe recently bought
      one of my paintings to display in the cafe.

      As you suggested, I have adjusted the color scheme to include only the colors from Jam
      Cafe's interior. Please let me know as soon as possible whether you would like me to
      make additional changes.

      Best,

      Haruka Goto

         Jacqueline Garza, better known as Jag, was born and raised in Austin, Texas. As a child,
         Ms. Garza loved lo dance and play sports. She particularly excelled at basketball and,
         following her high school graduation, she was offered a professional contract with the
         local Austin team. However, she chose to pursue a university degree in economics
         instead. After completing her degree, Ms. Garza admitted she was still happiest playing
         basketball, and finally joined the Austin team.
         Ms. Garza is known for her skill and speed as well as her kindness and team spirit. Off
         the court, she founded an organization called Reading is a Breeze. This organization
         provides resources to libraries that receive limited funding for print and audio books,
         young-adult periodicals, and digital reading devices. It even provides glasses to children
         whose parents have difficulty purchasing them on their own.

        As promised, I researched a possible celebrity endorser to work with us on the expansion
        into the United States market. Jacqueline Garza is a professional basketball player from
        Austin, Texas, with an interesting background. Her nonprofit foundation, which focuses on
        children's literacy, has a natural connection to our products at Bonvue. You can learn more
        about her by visiting her Web site, www.jaqgarza.com. If you approve of the idea, I will
        try to connect with her agent to negotiate her compensation.

        I also spoke with Mr. Roy this morning. He says that because the publicity campaign has
        been temporarily delayed, Marketing does not need us to have the spokesperson lined up
        until June.

                 To:      Customer Service Personnel
                 Subject: Meeting next Friday
                 Date:    November 19

                 Last week we conducted a study to gather opinions about our customer
                 service. The data are in and they look good. Most people expressed
                 satisfaction with their communication with our representatives. Their
                 questions about packaging services, shipping charges, and the status of
                 their parcels were answered professionally and promptly.
                 One area that we need to address is the low number of referrals. Few
                 customers we approached reported telling others about our services. Based
                 on the answers, most people are repeat customers who always rely on us
                 for their shipping needs, or they choose us based on our advertising.
                 Clearly, we fail to request referrals properly.
                 Therefore, our meeting next Friday will center around this topic. I will
                 design materials and practice activities to correct this shortcoming. But I
                 would also appreciate it if you could come up with some creative ways to
                 improve our referral rate. Send me your suggestions and I will be sure to
                 include them in our discussion. I look forward to hearing from you all.

           the Information Technology office?
           April Denner 10:25 A.M.
           We really can't afford to lose them.
           Jorge Avila 10:26 A.M.
           Not in this building. With Ms. Denner's OK, we could use the van to pick up the ones in the
           warehouse in Mindones. I think we have 3 or 4 there. But the earliest I could get back is tonight.
           April Denner 10:28 A.M.
           Jorge, I'm authorizing you to make an emergency purchase of portable AC units for the IT office
           right away. Please decide on the number of units needed, determine the cost, and report back to
           me as soon as you have set up the purchase.
           Jorge Avila 10:28 A.M.
           I'll get started on that now.
           April Denner 10:29 A.M.
           If you can't get a local appliance outlet to deliver by the afternoon, send someone in the delivery
           van to pick them up.                                                                                    -

       Please describe the problem you are experiencing.
          We started using your Web-conferencing software in June and have been pleased
          with it overall. Yesterday, however, we had several interruptions in service during an
          important training session. In the middle of our meeting, the screen suddenly went
          black and a notice appeared stating, "Quipwerx is down for maintenance." Several
          employees were calling in from overseas, and after this notice appeared multiple
          times, we decided to reschedule. Is there a way for you to inform us of your
          maintenance schedule in advance? If not, I will probably terminate my membership.
          I must be confident that I can use your product anytime I need it.

        Thank you for contacting us with your concerns. The issue you had this past Wednesday
        was caused by servers that crashed due to a database communication issue. We could not
        anticipate this problem, so we were unable to warn customers in advance. I assure you that
        this type of occurrence is very rare.

        In light of your comments, we have decided to reword our alert message from "down for
        maintenance" to "experiencing technical difficulties." That way customers will know the
        problem is due to unforeseen circumstances rather than routine maintenance. As a matter
        of fact, our software is hardly ever down for maintenance. When we work on an upgrade,
        the software is unavailable for just a few minutes, if at all.

        We regret the inconvenience this has caused you and are truly grateful for your feedback.
        In appreciation of your business, we will be waiving the service fee on your company
        account for this month.

      Dear Mr. Sukbara,

      Per your request, I have reserved your round-trip ticket to Perth. Departure from Sydney is
      20 July, and return from Perth is 24 July, which should perfectly accommodate your 21-23
      July Trade Show. The itinerary is attached.

      In reply to your question whether your samples can be brought along, the skis and
      snowboards can be checked as luggage. My contact at Canberra Airways tells me there is
      a $75 AUD fee for each piece of oversized luggage. If this fee is paid in advance,
      oversized items can be dropped at the express drop-off kiosk when you check in. Make
      sure that your items do not exceed the airline's maximum allowable weight and size
      requirements. Please let me know how many items you wish to check so that I can make
      the prepayment for you.

      Best,

        Dear Mr. Perez,

        I am the owner of the Morris Country Inn in Canton. It will be closing permanently when
        I retire next month. I have many pieces of furniture in excellent condition- beds, desks,
        easy chairs , and more. A friend suggested that this inventory could be donated to your
        organization. The New Start Home branch in Hartford seems to be the closest to my inn,
        and I see that you are the store manager there. We are located almost 35 miles away. Can
        I arrange a pickup of these goods at my establishment?

        Regards,

        Brenda Morris

                                been a big part of my life, and it will be hard

           Dear Mr. Lee,

           We would be happy to accommodate your requests as outlined on your order form.
           Unfortunately, however, we are currently out of the Witeglow brand whiteboards . I can
           recommend another brand of magnetic whiteboard that has been well liked by other
           customers, called Stellar Whiteboards. They are considered the best on the market. They
           are typically $85 each, but I am willing to provide four at the same cost of the
           Witeglow brand, if you would like to give them a try. Just let me know. Thank you.

                                    Two weeks ago I ordered a shipment of books
                                    through dealdirect.co.ke. I did not receive the
                                    shipment, which was scheduled for 20 April.
                                    I called the shipping company, and the
                                    representative said that she has a record of
                                    someone accepting the package, but the
                                    signature is not legible. I called Deal Direct to
                                    make sure that the address they have on file
                                    for me is correct, and it was. I'm trying to figure

                                    apartment building, but no one has responded.
                                    I wonder if I should just forget about it and
                                    reorder books from a different company or
                                    spend more time trying to resolve the matter.

                                    Ashby Logo Gets a New Look
                                    (30 July)-A new logo for the city of Ashby
                                    was unveiled by Mayor Charles Cavanaugh on
                                    Tuesday. The logo and its accompanying
                                    slogan, "Ashby Connects," will be put to
                                    official use immediately. - [l] -.
                                    The new design uses elements from Ashby 's
                                    original logo, including the red banner and the
                                    year of the city's founding. - [2] - . But an
                                    image of the city's skyline in silhouette gives
                                    the new design a more contemporary feel. The
                                    slogan communicates Ashby's focus on
                                    creating community connections. - [3] - .
                                    While Mayor Cavanaugh insists that the new
                                    logo is popular, not everyone is happy. "Why
                                    all the fuss?" asked lifelong resident Noelle
                                    Davidson. "The old logo was very
                                    recognizable. I don't know why they went to
                                    the trouble of replacing it." - [4] - .
                                    Local maps and the letterhead for official
                                    correspondence have already been printed
                                    with the new logo. Residents will also soon
                                    see it in promotional campaigns for events in
                                    the area, such as the annual used-clothing
                                    drive and the summer music festival. The logo
                                    and slogan are registered trademarks and may

       Dear Mr. Gillis:                                                                              LJ
       Thank you for sending me your signed contract. It was good to meet with you last week
       and to hear about your vision for the woodworking business you hope to create.

       Based on the features you want your woodshop to have, I have some solid ideas with
       which to move forward. From our conversation, I also understand that you have some cost
       concerns. I will certainly be conscious of this when working on the design plans and will
       be sure to use materials that are both structurally sound and economical. You can expect
       some preliminary sketches within the next two weeks. Once you have looked them over,
       let's set a time to meet again, at which point any adjustments can be made and finalized.

       I have already noted where your large pieces of machinery will be located. However,
       please let me know if you change your mind about anything, as I will need to figure out
       where the high-powered electrical outlets should be installed. For the purpose of safety, I
       am required to ensure that all large pieces of equipment such as table saws have their own
       dedicated circuits.

       I am looking forward to collaborating with you to turn your ideas into reality.

       Best regards,

       Pete Barth                                                                                    ,7

         The Centerville Times,June 1, "Music on the Water"
                                                                                                      -â€¢
         The magical melody of a violin wafts into downtown Centerville. The sound of a
         cello joins in. Curious tourists look around, trying to figure out the source of the
         music. They gradually realize that members of an orchestra are in plain sight, seated
         on a boat docked in the Centerville harbor.
         "Music on the Water" began 30 years ago when Brigitta Carlson had an old cargo boat
         renovated and then performed the first musical performance from the boat's deck.
         Today, "Music on the Water," a chamber orchestra, offers weekend performances on
         the original boat in the same harbor location.
         The musicians are currently led by Maestro Arthur Silverman, an acclaimed violinist,
         who plays in the performances each week. "We have expanded our schedule to offer
         a record number of concerts-over 50 each year," explains Maestro Silverman.
         "Certain programs arc now tailored to specific audiences, like young listeners."
         "Music on the Water" performs on many Friday and Saturday evenings at 6:00 P.M.
         Tickets can be purchased online at ,v,vw.musiconthewater.org. Family concerts are
         scheduled on Sundays at 2:00 P.M. No tickets are needed for family concerts, but
         patrons are encouraged to arrive early to ensure seats are available.

         I have enjoyed "Music on the Water" ever since I was a child. In fact, I will never -
         forget listening to the founder's very first performance, with the melody of her
         flute floating up to my family's third-floor apartment facing the harbor. When I
         was a little older, I used to save my coins so that I could purchase my own ticket
         to a concert on the boat. "Music on the Water" has had a wonderful impact on the
         harbor area. I wonder if The Centerville Times would consider publishing a piece
         on the history of this neighborhood, which I am still proud to call home.
         Thank you,

           that some of the items I purchased are going to be heavily discounted. Would it
           be possible for me to get a refund for the applicable items and then rebuy them

       Thank you for your message and your continued business with Carson Office Supplies.
       Unfortunately, only items purchased on the official sale dates are eligible for the sale
       prices.

       Because you have a business account with us , however, you automatically receive a
       20 percent discount on bulk items (purchases of fifteen or more of the same item), which
       is deducted when you make a purchase through our online business portal. I can see from
       your order that this was the case for some of your items.

       I can also offer you a 10 percent off coupon on your next purchase. The coupon is
       attached- it specifies the access code that you can use online. I will also attach our return
       and exchange procedures for your future reference.

       Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

                                    Advertising with Mix 92 Radio
           Marilyn Nguyen, 13 August
           Has anyone advertised with Mix 92 Radio?

             James Defort, 15 August
             l have had advertisements running on Mix 92 Radio since last March. It has proved to
             be a smart choice: in recent months I have seen a significant increase in the number of
             customers visiting my business, Defort Automotive. Many tell me it was the radio
             advertisement that brought them in.

             When I signed a contract with the station, there was a problem with some unexpected
             charges. However, Ms. Jager from the advertising department brought my concerns to
             her supervisor, and the matter was quickly resolved. Ms. Jager even checked back
             with me a week later to ensure I was pleased with the outcome.

            Dear All,

             As my internship at Mix 92 Radio draws to a close, please know that working here has
             been a wonderful experience for me. I am grateful for the training and advice I have
             received over the past twelve months. I especially want to thank my boss and mentor,
             Alison Alvey, from whom I have not only learned the fundamentals of radio advertising,
             but also how to meet customers' needs. Her nomination for this year's Australis Trophy
             speaks volumes about her dedication to her clients and staff.

             I also appreciate the video recording you presented to me, showing me at work and at
             play here . I will miss joining many of you for lunches at the Hot Spot Cafe.

             Best wishes,

             Kathrin Jager

           I just heard about Olinawe, and I received your invitation to the celebratory event. This is
           such wonderful news! At school, I remember that you often talked about opening your
           own restaurant, and I am thrilled that it is finally happening!

        Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this event. I will be in France that weekend

        dinner.

                          Hello, Mary. We'll get to it soon. We had some
                          standing water in the entryway to clean up first.

                          Do you think the roof might have sustained

                          We actually located the source. It was a
                          clogged drainpipe in the supply closet. As
                          soon as that's cleared up, we'll take care of
                          the fence . The roof seems fine.

        Hi Peter,

        Next week's meeting needs to be rescheduled. The new office assistant, Martina, did not
        take into consideration that the clients' offices are located throughout the world and in a
        variety of time zones. Several would have had to stay after closing time in order to attend
        the meeting. I have already canceled the original meeting and sent apologies for the
        inconvenience.

        Could you please find time to review this with Martina? This is a task she will be
        performing regularly. I should have had you work with her before asking her to set up the
        appointment.

        Thank you,

            Bradley, I've come across a new software program that I think will be very useful for
            creating checklists to organize our projects. - [1) - . It's called Close Project, and it
            seems fairly easy to work with. - [2) - . Users log in to view a list of items that need
            to be completed for each project they are working on. - [3) - . This helps to keep
            better track of the progress of each project. There's even a mobile application that
            allows users to take photographs to show an actual problem, such as a broken pipe.
            - [4] - . I've downloaded a sample program. Would you be interested in coming to my
            office this afternoon to go through it with me? Let me know.

         Level 7, 500 Exeton Street
         Sydney, NSW 2000
         Dear Mr. Tomasen,
         I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to interview for the position of
         staff photographer with Slepoy Marketing. Although I am disappointed that I was
         not chosen, I enjoyed meeting you and your staff. Your decision to go with another
         candidate does not diminish my belief that your company is a first-rate marketing
         firm, which rightfully deserves the many awards it has won.
         Incidentally, during our meeting you happened to mention your upcoming
         mountain-themed campaign as well as the fact that your company often hires
         freelance photographers. I will be traveling in Asia for the next three months, and
         plan to shoot landscape photographs that might be appropriate for this campaign.
         Should you be interested, I would be happy to send you some of those pictures.
         Thanks again for meeting with me. I hope to have another opportunity to speak
         with you at this year's Graphic Arts Conference in Brisbane.
         Sincerely,
         Ye,,-E lM'll W ~

                                Theatre's first production, Backup, opened last
                                night to a full house. Theatregoers were
                                clearly delighted by this new musical, which
                                is based on a true story. Backup follows
                                Babette Jones, a young backup singer for
                                famous musical acts, through her 23-year
                                struggle to become a successful solo act.
                                Liverpool native Tami McClure, as Ms. Jones,
                                thrilled the audience with her wide-ranging
                                vocals. Paul Robinson, who played her
                                fearless manager, also put in a strong

                                Backup's strong production values and the
                                Cricket Theatre's reasonable ticket prices
                                point to a long and successful future for this

      Today I visited the new Stellar Chocolates shop that opened a few weeks ago
      in the former mill, expecting to see an ordinary candy store. What a surprise!
      I was delighted to taste some free samples while watching the chocolates being                                 I
      made by hand. I even had a chance to chat with one of the owners, who told me
      about the origin of their business. She met her co-owner ten years ago in a class
      at university, and they came up with the business idea for an assignment. They
      got such positive comments from their professor and fellow students that they
      decided to turn their idea into a career project. I look forward to many future
      visits, as the shop is just around the corner from my home.

                                   By Josie Hopkins, Kuraki Now Staff Writer
                                   Executives from Kuraki Motors returned to
                                   Toronto for an annual meeting of the nearly
                                   1,000 Canadian representatives of the brand.
                                   The two-day event kicked off on Friday
                                   morning with CEO Katsuhiko Nakamura,
                                   who gave a keynote address highlighting
                                   progress on the company's new manufacturing
                                   plant in Toronto. He was followed by Vice
                                   President Jiro Higa detailing increased
                                   production levels and expected growth.
                                   Attendees then had the opportunity to attend
                                   two days of seminars. But the highlight of the
                                   event was the unveiling of two new models,
                                   the sleek Daino sedan and Kuraki's new
                                   hybrid, the Pura. The models will be rolling
                                   into dealerships in August.

             The seminars on both days were informative as always. I wish that
             some were not scheduled at the same time and that more were offered
             before lunch on Saturday. Some of my colleagues were unable to stay
             for the afternoon sessions.
